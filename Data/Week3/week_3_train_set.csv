Love You Anyway,Luke Combs,63,140,53,49,15,32,20,-7,12B,"If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last

If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes

There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway

I know just tryin' to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm tryin' to say
Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change

There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks

Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone


Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the
Radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby

Got lost in the fray, I gave all I had for a time
Then by some strange design, I got a case of the empties
The ruler of my world, a lost forgotten pearl
When fire leaves a girl
Too burned to try my life
Living on the fault line
And at night

I just lay down and cry
The waters don't really go by me
Give me something I can see
Something bigger and louder than the voices in me
Something to believe

Didn't always do it right
Might've left the heat on high
Didn't know I had any left
Thought I finally met my death
Gonna do all I can
To stay away from the quicksand
Gonna do all I can

Nobody's gonna love you the same way
Some of us go astray, I walked so far from them all
Instead of dropping the ball, I seem to carry so many
The colors don't align, a question of time
I seem to lose what I find
Please give me a sign soon
Really wanna find out the truth
And at night

I just lay down and cry
The waters don't really go by me
Give me something I can see
Something bigger and louder than the voices in me

Tangled up in Blue,Bob Dylan,64,101,42,66,41,55,10,-13,11B,"Early one morning the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
""We'll meet again someday
On the avenue""
Tangled up in blue

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, in back of my chair
Said, ""Tell me, don't I know your name?""
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
A-heading for another joint
We always did feel the same

From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?

Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra

And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'

Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet

(Yo, left, yo, left) And not be a quitter
(Yo, left, right, left) No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse, I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, JAY-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me

You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me

I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
I can tell that we are gonna be friends

Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns and books, and show and tell
Playtime, we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall

And we don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

Tonight I'll dream, while I’m in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again

And they say

""She's so lucky, she's a star""
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
""If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?""

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning

He was growing in my garden and I pulled him out by his hair like a weed
And like weeds do he only came and grew back again
So, I figured this time I might as well let him be

Lemon Boy and me started to get along together
I helped him plant his seeds and we'd mow the lawn in bad weather
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So I got myself a citrus friend

But soon his bittersweet started to rub off on me
You'd think smelling like lemon zest would be pretty neat
I found out that my friends are more of the savoury type
And they weren't too keen on compromising with a nice lemon pie

So Lemon Boy and me, we just gotta get along together
I'll help him plant his seeds and we'll mow the lawn in bad weather
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So I got myself a citrus friend

But what if I run out of fertiliser?
What if the clouds run out of rain?
What if Lemon Boy won't grow no longer?
What if beaches dry of sugar cane?
Oh well
The whales start to beach themselves
Tortoise shells tear away from their spines
It happens all the time, it happens all the time

Lemon Boy and I, we're gonna live forever

Pull that thing over you likely to sore

Between the thrills

That doesn't sleep well

It won't last forever
Or maybe it will

You wear them so well

In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust

New ways to spend all my time
Some's gone and some doesn't feel right
I need a new place to stay
And I don't think I'm gonna find it
You say you want, but never will
Just take it back and tell me no
It's easier to be alone
Than to be lied to

Clean it out, tell me now

Can we go through the years?
Take you there every night
Say that it's only right

Try to recall the words you said
Can you slip into my dreams?
And then I'll never wanna wake up
I hear you talk when you're not there
It comes at me from everywhere
Oh, can you lose the rest of me
And take my mind away?

I did not believe the information
Just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom, boom, boom

""Grab your things, I've come to take you home""

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut

I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom, boom, boom

""Grab your things, I've come to take you home""
Hey, back home

I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me

Today I don't need a replacement

I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

Here in your arms, I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now, I think I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

More than a woman to me

Oh, now there are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love, I know I would die

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go

We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water — it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman

Tell her she wins if she'll just shut up

Each time I saw him I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know that he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered, ""I love you""
And he said that he loved me too and then he kissed me

He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before
He kissed me In a way that I want to be kissed forever more

And one day, he took me home to meet his mom and his dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side

Smile to keep the sky from falling down, down, down, down
Collect the love that I've been given
Build a nest for us to sleep in here
You know it's real

There are no signs
There are no stars aligned
No amulets, not a charm
To bring you back to my arms
There's just this human heart that's built with this human flaw
What was your question?
Love is the answer

I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
The man in a trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
Look out, kid, it's somethin' you did
God knows when, but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in a big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills, you only got ten

Walk on your tip-toes, don't try NoDoz
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a inkwell
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail
Look out, kid, you're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, and watch the parking meters

Oh, get born, keep warm, short pants, romance
Learn to dance, get dressed, get blessed, try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts, don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
Look out, kid, they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum

To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough

The start a simple touch
One night to push and scream

The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn
And nothing left to prove

How she swore that it never would end

And runnin' to live
Never worried about payin'
Or even how much I owed

Movin' eight miles a minute
For months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend

Searchin' for shelter again and again

You're talking while you're fast asleep
As I walk slowly from your house
Back in your room remain the words I wanna say to you
But couldn't leave my mouth
Does it come as a surprise?
Language of averted eyes
Silence is what I do best

Still, I hear it all
Wasting time around my head
So I talk to myself instead

Sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how
It's something that I can't do
Then what am I supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only I could please her

Indecisive feelings of enjoyment
Hold the thought, I think I need a moment
I'm aware there's somethin' I should tell you
But my voice annoys me
Bite my tongue off with a smile
I can't feel it anymore
'Cause recently the line is blurred
Between depression and bliss

Now I see that the times don't change
They waste away
But I just wanna sleep today
And I don't wanna talk to you right now
You say

But, I'm sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how

When I am not this hunchback that you see
I sleep beneath the golden hill
You who wish to conquer pain, you must learn, learn to serve me well

You strike my side by accident as you go down for your gold
The cripple here that you clothe and feed is neither starved nor cold
He does not ask for your company
Not at the center, the center of the world

When I am on a pedestal, you did not raise me there
Your laws do not compel me to kneel grotesque and bare
I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare

You who wish to conquer pain, you must learn what makes me kind
The crumbs of love that you offer me, they're the crumbs I've left behind
Your pain is no credential here
It's just the shadow, shadow of my wound

I have begun to long for you, I who have no greed
I have begun to ask for you, I who have no need
You say you've gone away from me
But I can feel you when you breathe

Do not dress in those rags for me, I know you are not poor
And don't love me quite so fiercely now, when you know that you are not sure

It is your flesh that I wear",302,folk,folk

You don't see the writing on the wall
Passin' by
Movin' straight ahead, you knew it all
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone, everything has changed

Play the game
You know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on
Only you can do what must be done
You know in some way you're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner
And you're trying to break free

Underneath the blazin' sky

All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's Fire

Don't know just how far that I can go (Just how far I go)

I can make it, I know I can

But you won't break the man

Underneath the blazin' sky

All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's Fire

I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burnin' in me
Burnin' in me

Just once in his life, a man has his time
And my time is now, I'm coming alive

I can hear the music playin'
I can see the banners fly
Feel like a man again, I'll hold my head high
Gonna be a man in motion

Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So, uh, tick-tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the **** that I'm kickin'
The lone ranger
Code red, danger
Deep in the dark with the art
To rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin', ""Goodbye,"" like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck
Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel
I make more noise than heavy metal

The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project
Then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, yo, flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with sixteen shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh'

It's the Method Man, for short, Mr. Meth
Movin' on your left
Uh, and set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like fame, my style'll live forever
Niggas crossin' over like they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a, ""Soo?""
'Nough respect due to the 1-6-ooh
I mean, ""Oh""
Yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson
Or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical bud make me—

Ooh
What? Grab my nut, get screwed
Ow
Here comes my Shaolin style
True

First things first, man, you're **** with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a **** nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat, rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man come to my center
You enter the winter
Straight up and down, now **** is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin', Ason Unique
Rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your **** ass

For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with **** in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is
You're **** with pros
And there it goes

Yo, chill with the feedback, Black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the **** your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aéropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe
Then attack the globe
With the buckest
Style, the ruckus
Ten-times-ten, men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your **** chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
He'll be comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My Clan increase like Black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare
Ge-Gecka-Genius, take us the **** out of here

The Wu is too slammin' for these cold killer labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now, that thought is just as bright as a twenty-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy, they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter fact, bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

Down all the years, down all the days
And I've cried for all your troubles
Smiled at your funny little ways

We watched our friends grow up together
And we saw them as they fell
Some of them fell into Heaven
Some of them fell into Hell

I took shelter from a shower
And I stepped into your arms
On a rainy night in Soho
The wind was whistling all its charms

I sang you all my sorrows
You told me all your joys
Whatever happened to that old song?
To all those little girls and boys

Sometimes I wake up in the morning
The ginger lady by my bed
Covered in a cloak of silence
I hear you talking in my head

I'm not singing for the future
I'm not dreaming of the past
I'm not talking of the first time
I never think about the last

Now this song is nearly over
We may never find out what it means
Still there's a light I hold before me
And you're the measure of my dreams, the measure of my dreams

Sometimes I wake up in the morning
The ginger lady by my bed
Covered in a cloak of silence
I hear you talking in my head

I'm not singing for the future

And a blade shining oh so bright
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in sky
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets
Oh, and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light
But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most of our one night together

Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
But when the day is done and the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver black phantom bike
When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole
Everything is stunted and lost
And nothing really rocks and nothing really rolls
And nothing's ever worth the cost
And I know that I'm damned if I never get out
And maybe I'm damned if I do
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart
You know I'd rather be damned with you
If I gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned
Dancing through the night with you

Faster than any other boy has ever gone
And my skin is raw, but my soul is ripe
And no one's gonna stop me now
I'm gonna make my escape

Speeding away on the wind to a new day

And listen to the things they say
Diggin' for gold in a hole in my hand

But tell me, where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper?
Talkin' 'bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots

But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday

Every day it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
So you never had no business, so save the drama, jerk!
Niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen no parts of the streets, G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies
'Cause you know they don't respect ya
So, nigga please, check nuts
Before you step to these motherfuckin' real G's

Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition ""Original baby gangsta""
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker, I'ma bank ya
Shank ya with my fuckin' shank if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
'Cause if you do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See, young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city — but Dre, you ain't from Compton

And ain't shit compared to real motherfuckin' G's

Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless

I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now, nigga, it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you gettin' treated like bootcamp
Got to follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson

Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it

With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags, and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

People moving out
People moving in
Why, because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you just can't hide
An eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on
Well, the only person talking about loving thy brother is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learning but the teacher
Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration, aggravation, humiliation
Obligation to our nation
Ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey
The sales of pills are at an all time high
Young folks walk with their heads in the sky
The cities aflame in the summertime
And oh the beat goes on
Evolution, revolution, gun control, sound of soul-shooting rockets to the moon
Kids growing up too soon
Politicians say, ""More taxes will solve everything,""
And the band played on

So, round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed nobody knows
Oh, Great Googamooga
Can't you hear me talking to you
Just a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey
Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live
Is on an Indian reservation
The band played on
Eve of destruction, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors, mod clothes in demand
Population out of hand, suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, ""End the war!""

To find perfection in my pride, to see nothing in the light
Or turn it off in all my spite

And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off

Or taking shortcuts and false solutions
Just to come out the hero

Towards a goal that's nonexistent

Heavy Eyes,Zach Bryan,74,140,47,91,3,61,30,-3,7B,"Remember when David dashed a twelve-pack

Two kids in the back, drunk off their ass
Screamin' in an old Bronco

And I recall what she said

You said it ain't so bad

Lucas thought he was gonna die
'Cause stars started fallin' out a night cloud
From a clear, midwestern sky

I recall what she said
Screamin' that the sky's red
It's burned into a younger man's mind
Remember all the days we had
I say it ain't so bad
Keep those heavy eyes soft and kind

Oh, when I'm old, I will recall
All the nights we spent outlaws
It's gettin' cold, but that sun is crestin'
And heavy eyes ain't born for restin'


Who's gonna drive us home, the boys and me?
Our walkin' staggered, vision blurred
One thing you'll come to know, the boys back home
Live for things like Dead Man's Curve

I recall what he said
He'd rather be gone and dead
Than living like those sad folks in town
I can't take this soul with me
If I go, I'm goin' quickly
Keep those heavy eyes free and proud

The Need to Know (feat. SZA),"Wale,SZA",64,94,54,41,49,21,30,-14,9B,"I guess maybe some little problems could arise
(There are always a few)
If anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad
(Devastating)
Because this is very good
(And that would be good)
That would be good too, the idea is to combine this and that

Tryna keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Tell everybody that we're just friends
But to be honest that platonic shit's for TV shows
Same place, we're with different folks
Case closed if they crack the code
Is it me, or is you cold?
Cause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes
Go put a sweater on or get a room
Forbidden fruit, swimmin' in your juice
Lot of ways I can get to you
But my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo

Still we keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Could somebody tell somebody
I'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go
Work

I'm not tryna pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time, we can hook up
We can hang out, we can just chill

Tryna keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Tell 'em all that we're just cool
As far as me and you, we got a simple code
Spendin' nights, well that's optional
No telephones in the afternoon
I know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin'
Every time your ass in the mood
Sharin' thoughts when we share a room
Though we barely talk when we share a room
In the dark, still see your curves
Body like what, swear to God you're a miracle

Still we keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Could somebody tell somebody
I'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go

I'm not tryna pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time, we can hook up
We can hang out, we can just chill

(What if?)
Is that like the end of the world or something?
(Certainly not!)
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
(I know!)
I mean really, what is the big deal? We go in there, we're in there for a while and then we come back out here. It's not complicated

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while

The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny

What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go? (Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes, I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time

Break your ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes  like Dennis the Menace

Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double-parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Who got got and who got shot
'Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window

I'm down with Eiht and Watts Up
Kam and Solo, they got nuts

I want the bomb  just like George Clinton

That's how I poke hot lead in your ass
With ""More Bounce to the Ounce"" in the dash
Mash up Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great , slow down for the dip
On 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive to keep the four from crashin'

Fills his life with pointless things

Don't waste it

Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sounds
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about

Fall on my face, do it again

Man, how 'bout you? Man, how 'bout you?
To be free, to be sold
To be killed, to be safe
In my head, I'm alone
I'm not dead, I'm ashamed
Just like you, I've been trying to escape
In my bones, I feel cold
I give thanks to the Lord
Industry, in the street
Let me go, let me be

Who loved you even though she knew you was wrong?
And right now she just might come shining through

And the glory of love, glory of love
Glory of love just might come through

And all your two-bit friends have gone and ripped you off

""Man, you ain't never going to be no human being""

About all those things that you've done
And who it was and what it was
And all the different things, you made every different scene

Something like a circus or a sewer
And just remember different people have peculiar tastes

When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned

Well they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem

When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon

Changing of the Guards,Bob Dylan,50,125,61,72,17,82,0,-11,4A,"Sixteen years, sixteen banners united over the fields
Where the good shepherd grieves
Desperate men, desperate women divided
Spreading their wings 'neath falling leaves

Fortune calls, I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
On Midsummer's Eve near the tower

The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid

They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil

I stumbled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you

The palace of mirrors where dog soldiers are reflected
The endless road and the wailing of chimes
The empty rooms where her memory is protected
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times

She wakes him up, forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long golden locks

Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning either get ready for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards

Peace will come with tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will offer no reward when her false idols fall
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating

One soft, infested summer, me and Terry became friends
Trying in vain to breathe the fire we was born in
Catching rides to the outskirts, tying faith between our teeth
Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house, getting wasted in the heat

And hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
With a love so hard and filled with defeat
Running for our lives at night on them backstreets
Slow dancing in the dark on the beach at Stockton's Wing
Where desperate lovers park, we sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings
Huddled in our cars, waiting for the bells that ring
In the deep heart of the night, we can let loose of everything

To go running on the backstreets
Running on the backstreets
Terry, you swore we'd live forever
Taking it on them backstreets together

Endless juke joints and Valentino drag
Where dancers scraped the tears up off the streets dressed down in rags
Running into the darkness, some hurt bad, some really dying
At night sometimes it seemed you could hear the whole damn city crying
Blame it on the lies that killed us, blame it on the truth that ran us down
You can blame it all on me, Terry, it don't matter to me now
When the breakdown hit at midnight, there was nothing left to say
But I hated him and I hated you when you went away
Wa oh, wa oh


Laying here in the dark, you're like an angel on my chest
Just another tramp of hearts crying tears of faithlessness
Remember all the movies, Terry, we'd go see
Trying to learn to walk like the heroes we thought we had to be
Well, after all this time, to find we're just like all the rest
Stranded in the park, and forced to confess

To hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
Where we swore forever friends
On the backstreets until the end

On a scheme he had
Told in a foreign land
To take life on earth
To the second birth
And the man was in command
It was a flight on the wings
Of a young girl's dreams
That flew too far away
Don't push too far your dreams are china in your hand
Don't wish too hard because they may come true
And you can't help them
You don't know what you might have set upon yourself
China in your hand
Come from greed
Never born of the seed
Took a life from a barren hand
Oh eyes wide
Like a child in the form of man
A prophecy for a fantasy
The curse of a vivid mind
Don't push too far your dreams are china in your hand
Don't wish too hard because they may come true
And you can't help them

You are there talking and I'm not listening
I am busy doing nothing and you're rudely interrupting
It's a myth and now I see it clearly
You don't have to be sad to make something worth hearing
Now I'm common and content, one more burden off my back

You don't wanna be a creator
Doesn't mean you've got nothing to say
Put down the pen, don't let it force your hand

I'm a ghost walking on an empty street
No name anymore, no need to call for me
I'm a long-lost hometown hero
Latent legendary past lives within me
If I had the offer to do it again
Make me invincible, invisible, or brain dead
If the body and the life were two things that we could divide
I'd deliver up my shell to be filled with somebody else

You don't wanna be a creator
Doesn't mean you've got nothing to say

You don't wanna be a leader
Doesn't mean you don't know the way

I Think It's Going to Rain Today,Randy Newman,35,85,29,12,95,20,10,-18,11B,"Broken windows and empty hallways

With frozen smiles to chase love away

You had to have the front page, bold type
You had to be a big shot last night

Well, it's no big sin
To stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone
But you went over the line
You couldn't see it was time to go home
No, no, no, no, no, no

You had to be a big shot, didn't cha
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't cha

Hold me in your arms, tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever

Scar,Missy Higgins,58,92,65,79,38,83,20,-6,8B,"He left a card, a bar of soap
And a scrubbing brush next to a note
That said, ""Use these down to your bones""
And before I knew I had shiny skin
And it felt easy being clean like him
I thought ""This one knows better than I do""

A triangle
Tryna squeeze through a circle
He tried to cut me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar?
Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver;
The way things coulda gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar
When everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember
To never go that far
Could you leave me with a scar?

So the next one came with a bag of treats
She smelled like sugar and spoke like the sea
And she told me, ""Don't trust them, trust me""
Then she pulled at my stitches one by one
Looked at my insides, clicking her tongue
And said, ""This will all have to come undone""

A triangle

She tried to blunt me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar?

And doesn't it feel peculiar
When everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember
To never go that far
Could you leave me with a scar?

I think I realised just in time
Although my old self was hard to find
You can bathe me in your finest wine
But I'll never give you mine
'Cause I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be
The bad fruit nobody buys
Tell me, did you think we'd all dream the same?

So scarlet, it was

The rust that grew bеtween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands

You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway

Doing It Wrong,Drake,73,101,40,17,84,12,10,-16,11A,"“Doing It Wrong” is soft, low-tempo, break-up ballad with a harmonica solo from the legendary Stevie Wonder.
The song interpolates Don McLean’s 1977 song “The Wrong Thing To Do.”
When a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, ""I love you too""

But I need someone different

Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different

Oh, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different

We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you

Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do

In some ego-filled late-night crowd
Seems to be where I feel the most alone

I'd like to get lost on some old back road
Find a shade tree and a honey hole
And talk to my grandpa again
And I see God in everything
The trees and pain and nights in the spring
So why do I still long for a home?

I'd like to lay in a field on a cozy blanket
And feel the fear of never wakin'
To know thе true warmth of the sun
I'd like to lovе my lady long and hard
And lay down lines of laymen guitar
Never leave her lovin' arms again

My exes hate me and my friends all miss me
I wanna drown in rotgut whiskey
Leave this small town for a while
Head to Paris on a late-night flight
Find a bar and get in a fight
Write a few poems on a sunny balcony

I wanna be a child climbin' trees somewhere
Breathin' in the fresh, outside air
And before I knew this life was unkind
I want a well-trained dog on a couple of acres
A kind, kind lady and a place to take her
Few good friends I can count on one of my hands

I know I'm bound to die one day
So when I reach those golden gates
I pray to say I did the best I can
Sit with my mother and the dearly departed
Send a prayer down to the broken-hearted
Let 'em know it all turns out just fine

To know me is to love me and to hate me is to wrong me
I prefer my nights so lonely
Love blues guitar, muscle cars, and gin
I'm a simple man, I don't need much
Just my simple songs and some human touch

To her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half-crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said, ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know you can trust her

And he shoots you dead and he eats your head

You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too

And eat up bars where the people meet

Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars
Won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race

Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation

Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""

And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade""

Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, and let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end, we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, ha, ha)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, ha, ha)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
And give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
Just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
Just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on

I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life

And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night
And if I made a fool, if I made a fool
If I made a fool on the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this

When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned
You think over and over, ""Hey, I'm finally dead""

You can turn it on yourself, you ridiculous clown
You'll forget what you meant when you read what you said

I must say that I love you, so

Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than I've ever known

Every day is a battle I face
Strange life I live, but it's what you've decided
I give it all into your hands
Do what you will with me
And I'll, I'll smile when you speak
Remember all those times I was hoping for something?
And shaking my head from all I had done

Dark Eyes,Bob Dylan,40,87,63,4,81,42,0,-20,9B,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking
And the midnight moon is on the riverside
They’re drinking up and walking
And it is time for me to slide
I live in another world
Where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
And all I see are dark eyes

A cock is crowing far away
And another soldier’s deep in prayer
Some mother’s child has gone astray
She can’t find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum
Beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature’s beast fears as they come
And all I see are dark eyes

They tell me to be discreet
For all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet
And from where they stand, I’m sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game
Where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame
And all I see are dark eyes

Oh, the French girl, she’s in paradise
And a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy price
To the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
And passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet
But all I see are dark eyes",307,folk,folk

Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my father he told me
""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
""When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""

He said, ""One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember""
My father told me when I was just a child
""These are the nights that never die""

Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars

Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are""

I keep waving at the taxis they keep turning their lights off
But Julie knows a party at some actor's West Side loft
Supplies are endless in the evening by the morning they'll be gone

When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening by the morning looks like shit

And I know you have a heavy heart
I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me
Have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me, I'm not a gamble
You can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening
By the morning won't exist

You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
You just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
Well, it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening by the morning's such a drag

I got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
Well, we might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane

And I'm not sure what the trouble was
That started all of this
The reasons all have run away
But the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend
But it is one way to live

By the morning never is

Vanished from my hand

I have no one to meet
And my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And, but for the sky, there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest

It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin' out the fake cellphone and name
Big fame! She like cats with big thangs –
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the 6 Range
I seen her on the ave., spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance, with the fat booty pants – hot damn!
""What's your name, love? Where you came from?""
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leavin' now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica –
She's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up

Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""Aiyyo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (""Say word!"")
Yo, it's the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin' to play me for the herb (""Yeah, that's her"")
Shocked as hell, she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
""How you feelin'?"" ""Oh, I'm fine,"" ""My name is Mos,"" ""I'm Sharice""
""I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet""
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin' directly next to me
I'm type polite, but now I'm lookin' at her skeptically
'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes, and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fuckin' with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh — yeah, you know me, bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance wit' me?""

For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

I played it low though
I was like, ""Yeah, aight, come on then, let's go...""
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell ya
Yo, honey was so blazin', she was just...
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond – to my mother, man
She was that ill, man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin' to me...

""Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But, baby, you know what it's like –
Some brothers don't be comin' right""
""I understand, I'm feelin' you –
Besides, 'Can I have a dance?' ain't really that original""

They playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin' my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished, and she whisper, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""
Scene 3 — weeks of datin', late night conversation
In the crib, heart racin', tryin' to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin', singing Gregory Isaacs
Like – ""If I don't, if I don't have you...""
Showin' me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin' Sade, ""Sweetest Taboo""
Burnin' candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man – I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O. – ""Come now,"" I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk
Cockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up
Three months — she call, I feel I'm runnin' a fever
Six months — I'm tellin' her I desperately need her
Nine months — flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really tryin' to lock it down
Midnight, we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, ""Sweetheart, I got to have it""
She tellin' me commitment is somethin' she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic – gahdamn it!
My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My ""911""'s unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, ""I saw Sharice at the Kitty Club
With some bangin' ass Asian, playin' 'lay it down and lick me up'""

Ready to Take a Chance Again,Barry Manilow,49,101,25,53,78,26,0,-10,8A,"You remind me, I live in a shell
Safe from the past and doin' okay
But not very well
No jolts, no surprises
No crisis arises, my life goes along as it should
It's all very nice
But not very good

And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to put my love on the line with you
Been livin' with nothin' to show for it
You get what you get when you go for it
And I'm ready to take a chance again with you

Romeo & Juliet,Peter McPoland,56,161,32,48,45,8,50,-7,8B,"Some day down the road, I hope to be your Romeo
I'll climb the wires to your landline
While you're crying on the telephone
And you're sitting, feet dangling
Cheeks so rosy red and saying
""Baby, I was so upset, I thought you'd never set me free""
(""Hello?"")

I'd say, ""Oh, I love you"" to my Juliet
""If you only knew, I'd kill for you
I am for you
I am just who you need me to be
Let's get down and let's grow old
This fire escape is getting cold
I love that dress, I love the rest
Of all that you've got going on""

One day when the lines have all been read and memorized
I hope you mean it when you say that
I am yours and you are mine
See me down here, on my knees
I'm begging, won't you marry me?
I love that dress, I love the rest
So Julie let the show go on

But how do you know?
Is it just something hitting you?
Do you remember a bit of ""Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"" now?
Yes (Look, just do a bit for me)
No (Why not? I don't, I don't mean, I don't mean an acting bit)

I can't talk to you or your friends

This will not do
'Cause I was raised up
To be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn, it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that
When the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of
Every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me, but
I learned not to want
The quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go, ""Oh""

Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin' dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, they know I'm buyin' dem

Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin' them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my Daytons

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I wore spurs at first now there's tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (you wildin') fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

Now sometimes I get em free and some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and the platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

Now in the box is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine (peep mine)
Rock em once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

The Partisan,Leonard Cohen,56,87,42,21,89,34,10,-18,6A,"When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender
This I could not do
I took my gun and vanished

I have changed my name so often
I've lost my wife and children
But I have many friends
And some of them are with me

An old woman gave us shelter
Kept us hidden in the garret
Then the soldiers came
She died without a whisper

There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
But I must go on
The frontiers are my prison

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from the shadows

Les Allemands étaient chez moi
Ils me dirent, ""Resigne-toi,""
Mais je n'ai pas pu
J'ai repris mon arme

J'ai changé cent fois de nom
J'ai perdu femme et enfants
Mais j'ai tant d'amis
J'ai la France entière

Un vieil homme dans un grenier
Pour la nuit nous a caché
Les Allemands l'ont pris
Il est mort sans surprise

Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me

But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
Sets my heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears

Stole me a dog-eared map

Jealous, weeping
Or lost you? American mouth

Now I'm a fat house cat
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos

Thrown in the cold and clean

We can remember swimmin' in December
Headin' for the city lights in 1975
We're sharin' each other, nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world

We lived an adventure, love in the summer
Followed the sun 'til night, reminiscing other times of life
For each every other the feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, we got lost in your eyes

Lie in the sand and visualize like it's '75 again

Can love that's lost be found?

We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Oh, baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
'Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love in two

Someone Else Calling You Baby,Luke Bryan,67,115,50,92,5,35,0,-4,4B,"I saw a truck backing out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messing with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over cause I couldn’t believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whispering
A tear in your eye says I should have been listening

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I aren’t leaving till I hear you say what’s going on
It’ll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I’m gone

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart

Well, look here until then
They gonna buy your life's time

Till the day

We come in doing cartwheels
We all crawl out by ourselves
And your shape on a dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth to gouge my eyes

You'll be damned to be one of us girl
Faced with the dodo's conundrum
I felt like I could just fly
But nothing happened every time I try, ooh-ooh!

A duotone on the wall
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
Never dreamt of such sterile hands
You keep 'em folded in your lap
Or raise them up to beg for scraps
You know he's holding you down with the tips of his fingers
Just the same

Will you be pulled from the ocean
A-just a minute too late?
Or changed by a potion
To find a handsome young mate for you to love?

You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe
Well, do it now or grow old
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold


Been alone since you were twenty-one
You haven't laughed since January
You try and make like this is so much fun
But we know it to be quite contrary

Dare to be one of us, girl
Facing the android's conundrum
I felt like I should just cry

""Kids are different today""

Mother needs something today

There's a little yellow pill

She goes running for the shelter

And it helps her on her way
Gets her through her busy day

""Things are different today""
I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for her husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake
And she burns a frozen steak

And goes running for the shelter
Of her mother's little helper
And two help her on her way
Get her through her busy day

""Doctor, please
Some more of these""
Outside the door
She took four more
What a drag it is getting old

""Men just aren't the same today""
I hear every mother say
""They just don't appreciate that you get tired""

And four help you through the night
Help to minimize your plight

I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run 'til we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, babe
I want to know if love is real

Scream down the boulevard

Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist

On a last chance power drive

We wanted success
Until nothing was enough
Until my middle name was excess
And somehow I lost touch
When you went out of sight
When you got lost into the city
Got lost into the night

I was in need of help
Heading to black out
'Till someone told me, ""Run on in, honey
Before somebody blows your goddam' brains out""
You shoplifted as a child
I had a model's smile
You carried all my hopes
Until something broke inside

But now we'll float
Take life as it comes
We'll float
Take life as it comes

So will we die of shock?
Die without a trial
Die on Good Friday
While holding each other tight
And this is kind of about you
And this is kind of about me

I just don't remember

I went looking for it
Could have been anyone's kiss
Throwing my arms at no one

And it's growing all the time
I do myself a disservice

Feels so unfamiliar
You say something loving

It feels so unfamiliar

I feel it start sinking in
Here come my insecurities
I almost expect you to leave

Were you really looking for me?
Try your best to reassure me
I wasn't patient to meet you
Am I too needy, am I too eager?

And read each one out loud

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine


Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said, “You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away”
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back, and I hiccuped and looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God, there's got to be another way

Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on, tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

Come on, tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me who are you (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time?

I know my heart will guide me back

She didn't tell me there were rocks
Under the waves, right off the shore
Washed up on the sand, barely alive
Wishing the undertow would stop
How can a man take anymore?

Making my family lose their minds
I don't want to eat, I don't want to sleep
I only want Leyna one more time

Now, I'm in my room watching the tube
Telling myself she still may drop
Over to say she's changed her mind
So, I wait in the dark, listening for her
Instead of my old man saying
""Stop, kidding yourself, wasting your time!""

You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did

I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
Hey, why do you sing with an English accent?
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you out

And kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgettin'
But these things I do
You see, I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

Brandy (You're a Fine Girl),Looking Glass,80,125,72,63,40,83,10,-11,12A,"There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say, ""Brandy, fetch another round""
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved
He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

The sailor said, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes when he told his sailor's story
She could feel the ocean fall and rise, she saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth, Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

She hears him say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea

By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we wanna go

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone


And on, I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Prelude / Angry Young Man,Billy Joel,50,91,46,69,32,71,30,-10,9B,"There's a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl
And he's always at home with his back to the wall
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man

Give a moment or two to the angry young man
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good
And he sits in a room with a lock on the door
With his maps and his medals laid out on the floor
And he likes to be known as the angry young man

I believe I've passed the age
Of consciousness and righteous rage
I found that just surviving was a noble fight
I once believed in causes too
I had my pointless point of view
And life went on no matter who was wrong or right

And there's always a place for the angry young man
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand
And he's never been able to learn from mistakes
So he can't understand why his heart always breaks
And his honor is pure, and his courage as well
And he's fair, and he's true, and he's boring as hell
And he'll go to the grave as an angry old man


Yes, there's always a place for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl
And he's always at home with his back to the wall
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man",316,rock,rock 70s

I said the joker is a wanted man
He makes his way all across the land
I see him siftin' through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief in the night

He's always laughing in the midst of power
Always living in the final hour
There is always sweet in sour
So we are not goin' home

Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday? I wonder what would happen if he took her away

What you see, well, you might not know
You get the feelin' comin' after the glow
The vagabond is a-moving slow
So I'll tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief in the night

All the people that you see in the night
Hold their dreams up to the light
The wilder beast is searching for sight
And we are not going home

A-can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday? I wonder what would happen if he took her away


I said the joker is a wanted man
Makes his way all across the land
See him sifting through the sand

I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack, but you be doin' that
I'd rather say ""See ya"" 'cause I would never be ya
Be an officer? You wicked overseer
You hotshot, wanna get props and be a savior?
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?

While you're checkin' out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word ""overseer,"" like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity? Check the similarity
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you, ""What you're doin'?""
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuin'
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back, they put a hole in your chest
(Woop) They both ride horses
After four hundred years, I've got no choices
The police, dem have a likkle gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop, woop) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminal are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one D-T
But just a mere Black man, dem wan check me
Dem check out me car, for it shine like the sun
But dem jealous or dem vexed 'cause dem can't afford one
Black people still slaves up to today
But the Black police officer nyah see it that way
Him want a salary, him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it

In restless walks, she'll prowl the night

21 Questions,"50 Cent,Nate Dogg",79,93,65,81,35,90,0,-4,11A,"Hi, I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Ja Rule. Now, as previously stated in another episode, Ja Rule was the biggest rapper out for a while in the early 2000's. Platinum records, features, number one singles, babes, bucks, Ja Rule had it all. But, as time went on, people noticed a pattern with him, which was the constant usage of the ""thugs need love too"" formula to make hit songs, and for a long time, he was on top with it. Hit song after hit song, his ""pop gangster"" persona was blowing up, but then, there came a man who saw fit to call out this ""pop rapper"" for what he felt that he was: ""a studio thug"" who purely used his hardcore image to appeal to a female audience. That man was Mr. Curtis Jackson, a.k.a. 50 Cent. He'd call out Ja for not being a heartless thug, and instead being a punk, a softie! *footage of 50 calling out Ja* Sure, there's some origin about 50's friend stealing his chain and Ja Rule seeing that dude and 50 hanging out, but the main thing that people heard about was 50 calling him out for being a fake gangster, and sure enough, when 50 cent came into prominence, he would stamp out all of Ja Rule's club songs and love song, and replace them with… *""In Da Club"" and ""21 Questions""*… with club songs and love songs… Well, to 50's credit though, he did explain himself when releasing ""21 Questions"", the love song I wanted to look at today
When asked by Dr. Dre: ""How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?""
50 Cent responded with: I’m two people. I’ve always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that’s not diversity, it’s necessity
And you know what, I can get behind that, that's the dichotomy of man. you DO have your moments of anger, and you do have your softer sides. You can talk about wanting to kill at one point, and talk about wanting to be loved the next… well, wait a minute, if that's true, Mr. I'm so enlightened to the different aspects of humanity, why did you rag on Ja Rule so much when HE made love songs? What is HE not allowed to have his own dichotomy? That seems a little unfair. Reminds me of when he was in that whole thing with Kanye West, where he was a total sore loser about not selling as many records as Kanye, and decided to randomly taunt him for years, especially for using auto tune *audio clip of ""I Line Niggas', immediately followed by 50 performing ""Love Lockdown""*, but then, wait, what was that song he did the next year with G-Unit?
*""Rider, Part 2""*
Oh yeah, yeah…
So you see, my thing about 50 Cent is that he's always come off as a bit of a hypocritical bully, and with other rappers that I might like, yeah, they may be jackasses, but they do something that makes me look past it, like, yeah, Eminem's an ass, but dammit, he sure knows how to combine lyrics and flow to create masterful verses, and yeah, Kanye's an ass, but dammit, he sure does know how to make good beats and throw in a little socially conscious messages every now and then. But 50 Cent? Yeah, he's an ass, but he sure does, uh… spit typical gangsta rap lyrics over dark beats, because… THAT'S what everyone was waiting for!
But i dunno, if one of my favorite rappers of all time signed him, maybe I should give him a chance. After all, it's not just making a ""thugs need love too"" song that makes me not like a song, it's making a BAD song that makes me not like one, so let's check out ""21 Questions"" by 50 cent, and see how it fares
*intro*
Oh yes, but first we must have awkwardly rushed character establishment. Okay, so how do we establish a rapport between two people in in love in only 20 seconds?
*50 kisses money, laughs, girl in the back laughs*
*Laugh* Yes, I echo your thoughts concerning the hilarity of money
*police arrive*

Oh no, the cops! Maybe making all those songs in which I publicly admit to selling crack wasn't such a good idea!
*cops come in, song starts*
*video shows 50 riding in the back of an cop van*
""New York City! You are now riding… with 50 Cent!
Well, according to this video, you're riding in the back of a cop van. I wouldn't exactly call that your finest hour
You gotta love it!
Personally, I think riding in the back of a police vehicle kind of sucks, but whatever
I just want to chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 745
I just wanna let you know before this love song starts that I'm still totally a gangsta by smoking weed and showing off my expensive cars!
Girl, it's easy to love me now
And, of course, 10 points for including the closest thing the new millennium will ever get to Isaac Hayes, Mr. Nate Dogg on the hook
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

And I gotta give this song a few more points for actually being about something other than the general theme of ""i'm a thug, and you're my main bitch"". Instead of just that, it centers around a sense of doubt about his girlfriend's faithfulness that understandably stems from being really famous and having people around you that only care about you because of your money. He wants someone who's interested in more than money… despite what the intro may lead you to believe
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
And he starts off by asking directly: if all of his fame was over tomorrow, would you still care about him? It's straight up and to the point. And I wish he would have started with this instead of the ""riding in my car, smoking weed"" nonsense
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
You know, for most ""thugs need love too"" songs, they only dwell on a surface level depiction of a relationship, but to ask someone if they'd be willing to be emotional support if they were in jail for 25 years, that requires some reflection. And the delivery makes me feel like it really means something when he says it
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
Also, factoring in the realization that this man has actually been shot at 9 times, this is an alarmingly real possibility he's giving this girl to think about
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
Okay, that's kinda vague. You might want to elaborate what you mean, because, you know, one might confuse...
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
Okay, no confusion here, you're asking her to help you kill somebody. Got it
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
Yeah, he's asking questions about how you feel INSIDE, specifically about being an accomplice to murder

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thugging?
Would that be before or AFTER you convinced his daughter to be an accomplice to murder?
Are you mad cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Uh… does that count as one of the questions? Because now it sounds like you're trolling her. You mad I'm asking' you 21 questions? Yo mad, bruh?
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
Now THIS is a deep question, and the wording is important. Do you TRUST me enough to reveal your inner aspirations, the silly pipe dreams that fuel your motivations, or maybe he's talking about the actual dreams that she has every night, the ones that reoccur and haunt her, the ones that subconsciously unpack everything about her fears, joys, and---
I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans
…and… and that was a bad transition. I don't even think that was a question, you just said, ""Baby, tell me about the intricate inner workings of THAT apple bottom ASS… also, ya dreams, and shit...
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
Okay, this couplet always throws me off, no matter how much credit I try to give this song. Listen to the whole thing
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
Yeah, this always got to me. He says, ""If someone saw me with another girl, NOT if someone just told her he was with another girl, and it was ambiguous as to whether or not it actually happened, no, IF IT WAS TRUE that he was with another women and someone told you about it, will you believe him when he says it wasn't him."" To be clear, part of this song's in-depth compatibility quiz about your integrity as a human being in a relationship fundamentally involves you just kind of accepting the fact that he's eventually going to lie to you.. And what's oddly worse is that, after admitting to being the one who would lie and cheat on her in this example, he shifts the problems of the relationship back on HER
Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
Yes, 50 Cent's girlfriend: after lying and cheating on you, it's clearly YOU who needs to evaluate how seriously you're taking the relationship!
Yeah, these are the lyrics that almost ruin everything this song had going for it. Not the gangsterism's, not the singing intro by 50 cent, not even the line about cake and fat kids
I love you like a fat kid loves cake
You know my style, I'll say anything to make you smile
Yeah, it's corny, but by itself, it's kinda endearing, because in relationships, you're gonna have stupid little things you say to each other, and in the context of a song, if you don't overdo it, it can be fitting, but what ruins this for me is that this lyric comes immediately after the aforementioned lyrics, and sure these questions are mostly hypotheticals, and these scenarios may not have actually happened yet, but in this specific hypothetical situation, he has shown a blatant willingness to shift the blame on her despite him being the one that screwed up, succeeding these lyrics with limp backpedalling
We're only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it takes
I love you lil a fat kid loves cake
And THAT'S what makes this line bad to me: in this instance, after accidentally showcasing a possible warning sign of things to come in their relationship, he acts like a corny joke will be the thing to make her let it go, and that just doesn't gel well with me
Overall, though, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. Never underestimate the power of Nate Dogg's vocals, my friends. And in addition, 50 Cent does actually give a realistic and tangible depiction of his aspirations on relationships, and for about 80% of it, it's relatable and understandable. Yes, it has parts that turn me off of it, but I say in the end, this songs gets a pass from me. And to his credit, at least he didn't pull a Ja Rule, *play ""Always On Time""* and make a quote unquote ""love song"" that, in a sickening revelation, was ultimately just about a pimp-ho relationship. No, 50 Cent was pretty upfront when he made THAT song
*""Cause I' m a mothefuckin' P.I.M.P.!""*

There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me

Now dance, fucker, dance, man, I never had a chance
And no one even knew it was really only you
And now you lead the way
Show the light of day
Nice work you did
You're gonna go far, kid (Trust deceived)

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives


Now dance, fucker, dance, he never had a chance
And no one even knew it was really only you
And so dance, fucker, dance, I never had a chance
It was really only you

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes

He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?""

""I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don’t ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a minute, son""
And he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done!
Just take everything down to Highway 61""

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren’t right
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""
He says, ""Hmm, you’re right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done""
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now, the rovin' gambler, he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war

A baby being born to the overkill
Well, who cares what people say
We walk down love's motorway

Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
And singing hearts and flowers

But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see you through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true

A baby being born to the overkill
No say, no place to go

What's never been as one?
And our hearts have been torn
Since the day we were born
Just like anyone
From Westwood to Hollywood
The one thing that's understood
Is that you can't buy time
But you can sell your soul
And the closest thing to heaven is to rock and roll

Of little wings of white-flamed butterflies in my brain

That's where the pain comes in like a second skeleton
Tryin' to fit beneath the skin, I can't fit the feelings in, oh

What does she think of me? That I'm not what I ought to be
That I'm what I try not to be, it's got to be somebody else's fault
I can't get caught

If what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does
Then brother get back, 'cause my breast's gonna bust open
The rib is the shell, and a heart is the yolk
And I just made a meal for us both to choke on

Every single night's a fight with my brain, brain

I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything

So now I'm gonna try to be still now
Gonna renounce the mill a little while
And if we had a double-king-sized bed
We could move in it, and I'd soon forget

That what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does
And maybe I'd relax, let my breast just bust open
My heart's made of parts of all that surround me
And that's why the devil just can't get around me

Do Me a Favour,Arctic Monkeys,61,180,47,74,0,64,10,-7,10A,"A breakup song from the band’s second album Favourite Worst Nightmare. In a novel twist, the song is written from the perspective of the person in the wrong, who knows they’re in the wrong.
Well, the mourning was complete
When there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

It's the beginning of the end
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
To start to break in half, to start to fall apart, hold on to your heart

And do me a favour and break my nose
Or do me a favour and tell me to go away
Or do me a favour and stop asking questions

As she walked away, well, her shoes were untied
And the eyes were all red, you could see that we'd cried
And I watched and I waited till she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

Do me a favour and ask if you need some help
She said, ""Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself""
And to tear apart the ties that bind
Perhaps ""fuck off"" might be too kind
Perhaps ""fuck off"" might be too kind",205,indie,indie rock

I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin', he turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words, I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

But they're the only times I've ever known
And I believe there is a time for meditation
In cathedrals of our own
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes
And I can only stand apart and sympathize
For we are always what our situations hand us
It's either sadness or euphoria

So we'll argue and we'll compromise
And realize that nothing's ever changed
For all our mutual experience
Our separate conclusions are the same
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
Our reason coexists with our insanity
And though we choose between reality and madness
It's either sadness or euphoria

How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
Perhaps we don't fulfill each others fantasies
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives
With our respective similarities
It's either sadness or euphoria

She pulled up a chair, and gave me the bed

And I need to
Ask you, Jamie, oh

And tried to make her mine

About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had
The chance to

How all the changes came about my ways
And I wonder if I'd see another

I had a lover
I don't think I risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing
So long

And count the time in quarter tones to ten

1) Thuggish (Q.E.D.)
and
2) Ruggish (Bone Thugs coinage; an adjective to describe a “rogue”)

We're not against rap, we're not against rappers
But we are against those thugs
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

You're feelin' the strength of the rump, step up
Hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin', straight buzzin'
Lovin' your peoples cause we so real
Chill, better bring your weapon when steppin'
Bring on that ammunition, trip and don't slip
Not to mention, never knew no competition
But I gotta get mine
So scream out ""Mo'!"" and let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone, Mo' Thugs will follow
Chain gang remaining the same
Flaming my dank and drinking brew
Thinking about that hanging, clocking my bank
And thuggin' with trues, foo's

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

Get ready for the Bone and the Mo' Thug
Bustas, you know me as a hustla
Try to creep and get beat
Maybe six feet, peep, gotta put them under
Straitjackets, gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Bailin' in my black trench vest
You gotta be down to bang-bang
Come and get this teaching
You soldiers how thugstas must stack
Me drinkin' me brew 'til me skull crack
Wig blew all the way back
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

Now follow me now, roll, stroll off deep in the land
Well creep if you can
Take another swig to the brain rose
Loc'in, steady chokin' off that potent smoke
And running from the po-po now
Gotta get up with my thugstas
Right turn to the double Glock
Pull to the curb, smoke with my hustlas
Puff puff to the brain, shot
Love P-O-D'd and tweeded
Gotta get another case for my trunk
Olde English, really don't need it
But in case my trues wanna get drunk
They pump Bone
So leave 'em alone, you don't wanna get shut down
Thug runnin' the nine-quad
And you better believe they be running this thug style
So what now? See the Bone Thug clank
Thug never gonna change so flame up
Sit back and just smoke to the same cut
Leatherface on the creep and I came up

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

Gotta give it on up to the Glock-Glock
Pop-pop, better drop when them buckshot blow!
The Bone in me never no hoe so
No creepin' up outta the Ziplock
So Sin sip gin
And Lil Mo Hart run up, nut up and flipped in
Then slipped in the clip in
Next click and me blood the victim
Ever to test nuts, to the chest and put 'em to rest and
But I won't test bucks
Put a hole up into me vest and
Gotta get through my soul but they won't budge
Mug, drug, me victim
The blood in me runnin' my mental
The thug in me stuck in me keeping it simple
The bud in me running me pencil
To the temple, buck when you duck
To the thuggish ruggish T's
St. Clair P's to appeal to the G's
And a buck to all my enemies

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Boooooone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

We got Layzie, and Krayzie

Bitter the taste in my mouth

But I only see one way out

Scream without raising your voice
You know I took the poison from the poison stream
Then I floated out of here

Under a black belly of cloud in the rain

That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep
In the end it was something more, I guess
That tore us apart and made us weep

Each night I wait to get caught, but I never do

When our love was young and bold
She said last night she read those letters
And they made her feel one hundred years old

A Horse with No Name,"America,George Martin",82,123,65,51,69,83,10,-17,10A,"Written by Dewey Bunnell, this song was the band America’s first and most successful single, released in 1972. Originally titled “Desert Song,” then changed to the catchier current name.
On the first part of the journey
I was lookin' at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was lookin' at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can remember your name
Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la


After nine days, I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

But if I call, you gon' be like, ""Boo, why we haven't skyped yet?""
And on Skype, bet you say, ""'Le, where my flight at?""
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer, my life is quite deceptive
Women'll sell they soul, just to buy some attention
I need something to hold, fuck that passive aggression

I told her this here's overrated, but I love your city baby
Gotta get back to the D, you know we finally famous

Remember we were staring up to those peaks on the horizon?
I promised I would never stop it in your name I would climb them

There's nothing I have wanted more
The only one I've been waiting for

The end is unknown but still we ride

Counting down to the light, through the night
Just waiting for tomorrow
Almost there, almost time
All my life, just waiting

Is paved with rows and rows of very tempting parking spaces

Wait, is this the song with the drums?

I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, ""Dude, nice try""
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end

And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе

'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again

'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh

I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do

But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him

Said you wrote a while

In fluorescent light

Watch a wilting flower

And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth

I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke

That's somethin' that I learned in Tha Pound, so how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho?

Named Snoop Doggy? I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it, 'cause you know I don't love it

Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches

Ode to Viceroy,Mac DeMarco,65,95,52,63,21,31,10,-6,10B,"Mac says in an interview that one time he bought cigs called “Sheriff”. After smoking them and saying “they sucked dick”, he went back to Viceroy and as an apology to his beloved Viceroys he wrote this song.
Viceroy
Early in the morning
Just trying to let the sun in
And open up my eyes
Viceroy
As it's getting later
Heading for the corner
Already running dry

And oh, don't let me see you crying
'Cause oh, honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying

Viceroy
Don't take me for a fool now
I'm only trying to calm down
Just trying to keep it cool
Viceroy
As it's getting later
Heading for the corner
I'm leaving it to you

And oh, don't let me see you crying
'Cause oh, honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying

Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of Crown
And everybody's getting down
And this town ain't never gonna be the same

'Cause I saddle up my horse and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise 'cause the girls, they are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, ride a cowboy

Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and bling-blinging
While the girls are drinking long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town

And I saddle up my horse and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise 'cause the girls, they are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, ride a cowboy

I'm a thoroughbred, that's what she said
In the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road
We were flying high, fine as wine
Having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going just about as far as she'd let me go
But her evaluation of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation all night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Willie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love

And I saddle up my horse and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise 'cause the girls, they are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway on my old stud Leroy

Man, why can’t I just let it go?

If it were yours, there’d be some hippie bullshit hanging from the rearview mirror

Yours is dented up and down the doors

To ease this precious ache
And you don't know how much I'd give
Or how much I can take

Crawl inside
Wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window

Keeping my eyes open
I cannot afford to sleep
Giving away promises
I know that I can't keep
Nothing fills the blackness
That has seeped into my chest
I need you in my blood
I am forsaking all the rest

Just to reach you
Just to reach you
Oh, to reach you

Come to my window
Crawl inside
Wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon

I don't care what they say
What do they know about this love
Anyway?
Come, come to my window

I'm coming home

So all hail the honorable

It's to my real ill niggas, heavyweight hitters
Dough-getters, fifty ways to make figures
My niggas that come on the spot to feel sisters
Like they hear real spitters and kids on the zigga-ziggas
When it's ugly, then the club is lovely
Thugs be sippin' Hennessy and bubbly
To my comrades that keep it flamin' hot
On dangerous blocks, claimin' spots
Where the goal is to be one of the top-ranked soldiers
Forty-five holders, one of the high rollers
Get respect in the hood, credit is good
Knock it down lumberjack style, baby; extra wood
Rock it all night long, the bang-a-thon, baby, keep hangin' on
We like it with the lights on
Don't have to blow twenty thou' to get to know honey's style
Show her the town, steal her heart, no money down!

How about some hardcore? Yeah, we like it raw for sure
Broads on the floor, wall to wall
There's more at the door, players ball to score
‘Cause this right here is for all of y'all
Rakim and Preemo — yo, I got what you need, bro
You go see a show, smokin' El Niño
And DJ's play hits with hard bass kicks
And then they display tricks like The Matrix
Make the record fly, undetected by the naked eye
So just feel the vibe, ‘cause your ears never lie
Nowadays, DJ's bags of tricks–graphic
On some behind-the-back shit, catch it and scratch it
Blast it! This kid got his craft mastered
Hands is mad quick like he mix with magic
Spin it back and forth and grab it
And know just where it is… there it is!

To my elite peeps with the murderous mystiques
I hit the street with beats and they critique for weeks
They be like: ""How that kid Ra reach the peak?""
Pull out the heat and use my technique to speak
It's dangerous, sit calm and explain to kids
What part of the game this is in foreign languages
They hold Ra's events in different continents
Put my lyrical contents in monuments
In ghetto garments, I rock a towel like a pharaoh
Mind travel, design style like apparel
My fashions last long as a lifetime
‘Cause I can see the future when the god write rhyme
They're mad ‘cause I managed to reign so long
Like their chance to get money done came and gone
This is strictly for my listeners on the corners at night
And the sisters that be keepin' us right, when I be on the mic

And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above

Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew ya

If I Ruled the World (Imagine That) (feat. Lauryn Hill),"Nas,Ms. Lauryn Hill",72,94,88,56,5,52,0,-8,3A,"Life
I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know
Imagine smokin' weed in the street without cops harassin'
Imagine goin' to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruisin' blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feelin' like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Troopin' outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin' fashion
Designer clothes, lacin' your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holdin' dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time, watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon, Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seein' things like I was controllin', clique rollin'
Trickin' six-digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa, Africa

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

And then we'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand (hand)
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land (land)
We'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand (hand)
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land (land)

You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin' from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Tryin' to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the Gat with the cocked hammer
Makin' moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
'Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga havin' shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it
Sky's the limit, I'd push a Q45 Infinit'
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies, or B Felony
Strictly livin' longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?!

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

And my old man plays the trombone and works out at the track

He says that he loves me even though it's not his baby
He says that he'll raise him up like he would his own son
And he gave me a ring that was worn by his mother
And he takes me out dancin' every Saturday night

And hey Charlie, I think about you every time I pass a fillin' station
On account of all the grease you used to wear in your hair
And I still have that record of Little Anthony and the Imperials
But someone stole my record player--now, how do you like that?

I went back to Omaha to live with my folks
But everyone I used to know was either dead or in prison
So I came back to Minneapolis, this time I think I'm gonna stay

I wish I had all the money we used to spend on dope

We get lost talking, days gone by
But we're not getting any younger
And now it feels like real life has dragged us in its tide

So we stay awake like we always do
And we try to recreate
And though nothing's changed, and I'm next to you
It doesn't feel the same


I would never change what our past is
Written in our bones, it's who we are
I just can't control where my mind goes
When it goes too far

So we stay awake like we always do
And we try to recreate
And though nothing's changed, and I'm next to you

Where that weed? Nahmsayin'?
That old real shit

There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady!
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me, the Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act

But never that! As long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-O lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin, when he got bagged, that fucked me up, God
But shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples when you're Upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two-to-four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get, I'm stayin' in the projects forever!
Jakes on the blocks — we out-clever
If beef, we never separate, roll together
When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot
Fuck lookin' cute! I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin' L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the 'Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize

I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing

Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100

Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
Twenty-three and goin' through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right

And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks

And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh

I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lenin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""",516,rock,rock 70s

And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away

Do you need some time all alone?

When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside

I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away

I see my Marianne walkin' away

So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away


When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away

It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)

Broken,Gorillaz,62,159,49,92,0,70,40,-5,8B,"“Broken” is the 11th track on Gorillaz' 2010 album, Plastic Beach.
This song seems to be about a broken relationship and how both people are feeling empty without one another.
Live visuals:
Distant stars come in black or red
I've seen their worlds inside my head
They connect with the fall of man
They breathe you in, then dive as deep as they can

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between, when the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is in outer heart, and the space has been broken

It's broken
Our love is broken
It's broken
Our love is broken

Is it far away in the Glitter Freeze?
Or in our eyes every time they meet?
It's by the light of the plasma screens
We keep switched on all through the night while we sleep

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between, when the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart, and the space has been broken

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted

Calling my name and I follow just to find you
I trace the faith to a broken down television, and put on the weather
And I've trained myself to give up on the past 'cause
I froze in time between hearses and caskets
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
I wanna get better

While my friends were getting high and chasing girls down parkway lines
I was losing my mind because the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
That I gave wasted on a nice face
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away

So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was
Now I'm a stranger
And I miss the days of a life still permanent
Mourn the years before I got carried away

So now I'm staring at the interstate screaming at myself
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

'Cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi
I'm screaming from my bedroom window
Even if it's gonna kill me

Woke up this morning early before my family
From this dream where she was trying to show me
How a life can move from the darkness
She said to get better
So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
And I crash my car 'cause I wanna get carried away

She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""

Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around

Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now

Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try

Oh, forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain

When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone on the stage, my little dark age

Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial

You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away
If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing
All alone, horrified on the stage, my little dark age

Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind

Policemen swear to God, love seeping from their guns

Ticking away
The moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours
In an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground
In your hometown
Waiting for someone
Or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun


And you run, and you run
To catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
And racing around
To come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way
But you're older
Shorter of breath
And one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation
Is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells",413,rock,rock

She just goes stumbling through her memories
Staring out onto Grey Street

I dream myself a thousand times around the world
But I can't get out of this place""

There's an emptiness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
But all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart

How she wishes it was different
She prays to God most every night
And though she swears it doesn't listen
There's still a hope in her it might
She says, ""I pray
But they fall on deaf ears
Am I supposed to take it on myself?
To get out of this place?""

There's loneliness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
And though it's red blood bleeding from her now
It feels like cold blue ice in her heart
When all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart

There's a stranger speaks outside her door
Says, ""Take what you can from your dreams
Make them as real as anything
It'd take the work out of the courage""
But she says, ""Please
There's a crazy man that's creeping outside my door
I live on the corner of Grey Street
And the end of the world""

There's an emptiness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in

She could change everything about her
Using colors bold and bright
But all the colors mix together - to grey

Nobody gonna slow me down

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride

The River,Bruce Springsteen,67,117,59,54,18,59,30,-11,9B,"I come from down in the valley
Where, mister, when you're young
They bring you up to do
Like your daddy done
Me and Mary, we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
We'd drive out of this valley
Down to where the fields were green

We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride

Then I got Mary pregnant
And, man, that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday
I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
No flowers, no wedding dress

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we did ride
Ah-yah


I got a job working construction
For the Johnstown Company
But lately, there ain't been much work
On account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well, mister, they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
And Mary acts like she don't care

But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tanned and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks, I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true?
Or is it something worse?

That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight
Ah-yah-yah
Down to the river
My baby and I
Oh, down to the river we ride

She wanted to test her husband
She knew exactly what to do
A pseudonym to fool him
She couldn't have made a worst move
She sent him scented letters
And he received them with a strange delight
Just like his wife
But how she was before the tears
And how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she was beautiful

To see if he
Would fall for her incognito

Reminds him of his little lady
Capacity to give him all he needs
Just like his wife before she freezed on him

What comes after this momentary bliss?
The consequence of what you do to me

Canyon callin', would they come to greet you?

Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

As she came riding through the dark
No moon to keep her armor bright
No man to get her through this very smoky night

She said, ""I'm tired of the war
I want the kind of work I had before
A wedding dress or something white
To wear upon my swollen appetite""

La la la la la da

Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way
You know I've watched you riding every day
And something in me yearns to win
Such a cold and lonesome heroine

""And who are you?"" she sternly spoke
To the one beneath the smoke
""Why, I'm fire"", he replied
""And I love your solitude, I love your pride""

La la la, la da da, la la da da da da
La la la la la da
La la la la la da
La la da da da da

""Then fire, make your body cold
I'm gonna give you mine to hold""
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride

And deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of Joan of Arc
And high above the wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her wedding dress

La da da, la da da, la la da da la da
La da da da la da

It was deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of Joan of Arc

If he was fire, oh then she must be wood

I saw the glory in her eye
Myself, I long for love and light
But must it come so cruel, and oh so bright?

Could be there’s nothing else in our lives, so critical
As this little home

Marooned on a cliff
You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift

And you tell me with your tongue
And your breath goes in my lungs
And we float over the rift

I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
(Kick, push, coast)
Representing that 1st & 15th, yeah, uh
And this one right here (Woo!)
I dedicate this one right here (Uproxx...)
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about? (Woo!)
So, check it out, uh

First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss... (Ugh)
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air (Ugh)
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk
His neighbors couldn't stand it, so—
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark, yeah
When they said ""It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here""

And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

So let's kick... (Ugh)
And push (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)
And coast
Uh, uh, uh (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)

My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, ""hell-bent on killing himself""—
Is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what-what was happening to him now, ugh!
He said ""I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two""
She said, ""Bow! I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds"" (Woo!)
""Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here""
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some modern apartment parking lot
She said, ""I don't normally take dates in here""
Security came and said, ""I'm sorry, there's no skating here""

And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast (Yeah, ugh!)
(Haha, swanky)
Yeah, yeah!

Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said (They said)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head (They'd head) to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, ugh! (Theirs)
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, ""There's no skating here""

And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come roll with me

Follow me into a solo, get in the flow
And you can picture like a photo
Music mix, mellow maintains to make
Melodies for emcees, motivates the breaks
I'm everlasting, I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as x-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard
Flip it, now it's a daily word
I can get iller than 'Nam, I kill and bomb
But no alarm, Rakim'll remain calm
Self-esteem makes me super, superb and supreme
But for a microphone, still I fiend
This was a tape, I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I wanna see you keep following and swallowing
Taking and making, biting and borrowing
Brothers tried and others died to get the formula
But I'ma let you sweat, you still ain't warm, you a
Step away from frozen, stiff as if you're posing
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me and while you're thinking you were first
Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the universe
What could you say as the Earth gets further and further away?
Planets as small as balls of clay
Astray into the Milky Way, world's out of sight
Far as the eye can see, not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As you stare in the darkness, your knowledge is took
So keep staring, soon you suddenly see a star
You better follow it 'cause it's the R

Keep you moving 'cause the crowd said so
Dance, cuts rip your pants
Eric B. on the blades bleeding to death, call the ambulance
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone, murdering emcees
Let's quote, a rhyme from a record I wrote
(Follow the leader) Yeah, dope
'Cause every time I stop, it seems you're stuck
Soon as you try to step off, you self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showing and proving and letting knowledge be born
Then after that, I'll live forever, you disagree?
You say never? Then follow me
From century to century, you'll remember me
In history, not a mystery or a memory (Rakim)
God by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave
But remember, you're not a slave
'Cause we was put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, rebuild my name (Rakim)

A furified freestyle, lyrics of fury
My third eye make me shine like jewelry
You're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-made
I'll be here when it fade, I'll watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every traitor or snake, so stay awake
And follow and follow because the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
I'm not him, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed, slow down and let the leader lead
Word to daddy, indeed
The R's a rolling stone, so I'm rolling
Directions is told, then the rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin', a brother said dig him, I never dug him
He couldn't follow the leader long enough, so I drug him
Into danger zone, he should arrange his own
Face it, it's basic, erase it, change your tone
There's one R in the alphabet
It's a one letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B. be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state, followers tailgate
Keep coming, but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up, regroup, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant, clap your hands, you won a trip
The price is right, don't make a deal too soon
How many notes can you name this tune?
Follow the leader is a title, theme, task
Now you know, you don't have to ask
Rap is rhythm and poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might catch up if you follow the records E wrecks
Until then, keep eating and swallowing

Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house

You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

Do you think about my old Jeep

As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you been thinking about ditching me

When I come around

So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite, I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant, Rosie, and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft, sweet, little girl's tongue
Ah, Rosie, you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry, baby, playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's, tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner, waitin' for the bus
Mama, she's home in the window, waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs, ‘cause you know we ain't gonna come
Ah, I ain't here on business, baby, I'm only here for fun
And, Rosie, you're the one

Rosalita, jump a little lighter
Señorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your love, ain’t no lie
Rosalita, you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie, don't you know they're gonna be there?
Ah, Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billy, they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel all right
So, Rosie, come out tonight, oh, baby, come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh, closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it, Rosie, that's what it's there for

Rosalita, jump a little lighter
Señorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your love, ain’t no lie
Rosalita, you're my stone desire
All right


Now, I know your mama, she don't like me ‘cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy, he don't dig me, but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom, he locked you in your room
I'm coming to lend a hand
I'm coming to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this, and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't (Have any money)
Whoa, your papa says he knows (That I don't have any money)
Whoa, so your daddy says he knows I don't have (Papa says he knows that I don't have any money)
Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because the record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance!

And my tires were slashed, and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy
And my machine, she's a dud, I'm stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, ‘cause, Rosie, I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little café where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear 'em in the back room strummin'
So hold tight, baby, ‘cause don't you know daddy's comin'?
Oh, everybody, so!

Jennifer’s version peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped Billboard’s dance music chart in 1999.
Oh, yeah

Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks
I just want you to know I can see through your masks

You that never done nothing but build to destroy
You play with my world like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive
A world war can be won you want me to believe
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain

You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children into the world
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins

How much do I know to talk out of turn?
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll
All the money you made will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die and your death will come soon
I will follow your casket by the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave 'til I'm sure that you're dead",271,folk,folk 60s

Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
'Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is

And all I know of love is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it
So I've made my mind up I must live my life alone
And though it's not the easy way, I guess I've always known
I'd say goodbye to love
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
And to live for something I could live for
All the years of useless search have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend
From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I can
What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song
And it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to love",238,pop,pop 70s

Let the Sun In,Wallows,51,190,32,66,0,67,10,-6,8B,"“Let The Sun In” is one of six songs on Wallows' debut EP, Spring. This song is about growing up and realizing that the feelings you have for someone aren’t just physical or trivial– you’re really in love.
Help me, darling, now I'm feeling lonely
Help me, darling, now I feel afraid
Ah, help me, darling, now I'm feeling older
And I know the time, it doesn't wait
Help me, darling, now I'm feeling tired

And I just want to find

All the secrets that you keep inside
Oh, I do

Help me, darling, now I'm feeling so lost
And help me, darling, now I'm feeling shy
With you, I see the world completely different
With you, I need no place to hide

And some would like it best if they're headed for your chest
But I just wanna talk again tonight
And some would be okay just washing you away
But I don't want to do that anymore

"Lover, You Should've Come Over",Jeff Buckley,83,119,39,60,36,15,10,-6,10B,"Looking out the door, I see the rain
Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind
So you never know

Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child?
You know how much I need it

Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run

Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no one

So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return?
Oh, will I ever learn?

Oh, oh, oh
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
Mhm

Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him

My body turns and yearns
For a sleep that won't ever come

It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Oh, but maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Lover, you should've come over
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, I, I feel too young to hold on
And much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done

Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside""

Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

They say I'm crazy, but I have a good time
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime

I lost my license, now I don't drive
I have a limo, ride in the back
I lock the doors in case I'm attacked

I make hit records, my fans they can't wait
They write me letters, tell me I'm great
So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
Just leave a message, maybe I'll call
Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
Everybody say, ""I'm cool"" (He's cool)
I can't complain, but sometimes I still do

I go to parties, sometimes until four
It's hard to leave when you can't find the door

Like passing notes in secrecy

I started telling the story without knowing the end

I used to be darker, then I got lighter, then I got dark again
Something too big to be seen was passing over and over me
Well it seemed like a routine case at first
With the death of the shadow came a lightness of verse
But the darkest of nights, in truth, still dazzles
And I work myself until I'm frazzled

I started running, and things didn't pan out as planned

Creepin' down the back street on D's
I got my Glock cocked, 'cause niggas want these
Now soon as I said it
Seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a TEC-9
Tryna take mine
Ya wanna make noise? Make noise
I make a phone call my niggas comin' like the Gotti boys
Bodies bein' found on Greenleaf
With their fuckin' heads cut off
Motherfucker I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play
Day-by-day
Rollin' in my '4 with sixteen switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clockin' all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
'Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfuckin' D-R-E
From the CPT, on a rhymin' spree
A straight G
Hop back as I pop my top ya trip
I let the hollow points commence to
POP! POP! POP!
Yeah cause if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse
Go back and take another stop
'Cause I'm...

Rollin' down the motherfucking backstreets
With my drink and my cup and my strap in my lap, see

Just another motherfuckin' day for Dre
So I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists
It's just that gangster glare
With gangsta raps, that gangsta shit
Makes a gangs of snaps
Uh, word to the motherfuckin' streets
And word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit ya with, that I get ya with
As I groove in my 'fo on D's
Hittin' the switches
Bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
Bumpin' like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
I gotta get the chronic, the Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smellin' like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick 'cause my '4 on hit
Pancake front and back, side to side
And all that shit
So when I crawl I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip and make a trip to the south side
Yeah

Right back up in you it's the D-R-E
Witta ounce as we bounce through the CPT
Diamond in the back,  danas on the wheels
This is strictly for my bitches, now we're hittin' in switches
Niggas gettin' jealous cause' hoes be on our dick
But Dre don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
So the '4 won't blow
Stoppin' by the spot to get some indo
With all the motherfuckin' bitches sayin'...

Now as I roll with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Still clocking dough in '93 and '94, fuck a hoe
We blaze up the zig zags back to back
With the orange chronic bud blazing sack to sack
Humpin' and bumpin' that Doggystyle
On the eastside of the beach with the boomin' sounds
Got my drink on deck, got the strap and if the spot is feeling hot
Then feel the fire with my gin on rocks, it don't stop
Like I told you so, now let a nigga talk and flow, talk for riches
That way to get gold on gold on the black Liz-zac Coupe DeVille
Hydraulics and all that gangsta shit, so
On and on and you know it don't stop, put it in motion and let it roll on 3 and pose like a pimp
And hit 'em up with the pound, relax and sip up on the drink and smoke with everybody sayin'…..

Taxicabs and buses
Passin' through the night

How many times I wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, or think of it
It's life, and you just got to play the game

I find me a place in a boxcar
So I take my guitar
To pass some time
Late at night, when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I feel fine (I)

I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake

Ask if I'm in a movie, no, I didn't get the part

Sexy to somebody, it would help me out
Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house
And it's just a little thing I can't live without

Sexy is something I see in everything
Honey stickin' to your hands, sugar on the rim
Nothing more, nothing less, I've thought, take it all to heart
I want afterglowing, and when I call a car
Send me eyes with the knowing that I could pull it off
Ask if I'm doing TV, no, I didn't get the job

Sexy to somebody, it would help me out
Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house
And it's just a little thing I can't live without

I want to be sexy to someone (Is it too much to ask?)
I want to be sexy to someone (Then what's holding you back?)
I want to be sexy to someone (It's not too much to ask)

A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

Why do I tire of counting sheep

To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes

We just come from such different sets of circumstance
I'm up all night in the studios
And you're up early on your ranch
You'll be brushing out a broodmare's tail
While the sun is ascending
And I'll just be getting home with my reel-to-reel
There's no comprehending
Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
And the lips you can get
And still feel so alone
And still feel related
Like stations in some relay
You're not a hit-and-run driver, no no
Racing away
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

We saw a farmhouse burning down
In the middle of nowhere
In the middle of the night
And we rolled right past that tragedy
Till we turned into some roadhouse lights
Where a local band was playing
Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
And the next thing I know
That coyote's at my door
He pins me in a corner and he won't take no
He drags me out on the dance floor
And we're dancing close and slow
Now he's got a woman at home
He's got another woman down the hall
He seems to want me anyway
Why'd you have to get so drunk
And lead me on that way?
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

I looked a coyote right in the face
On the road to Baljennie near my old hometown
He went running through the whisker wheat
Chasing some prize down
And a hawk was playing with him
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
He had those same eyes just like yours
Under your dark glasses
Privately probing the public rooms
And peeking through keyholes in numbered doors
Where the players lick their wounds
And take their temporary lovers
And their pills and powders to get them through this passion play
No regrets, Coyote
I just get off up aways
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

Coyote's in the coffee shop
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
He picks up my scent on his fingers
While he's watching the waitresses' legs
He's too far from the Bay of Fundy
From appaloosas and eagles and tides
And the air-conditioned cubicles
And the carbon ribbon rides
Are spelling it out so clear
Either he's going to have to stand and fight
Or take off out of here
I tried to run away myself
To run away and wrestle with my ego
And with this flame
You put here in this Eskimo
In this hitcher
In this prisoner
Of the fine white lines
Of the white lines on the free freeway",301,folk,folk 70s

I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face, I see it's true

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me, how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long?
How am I supposed to live without you?
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone?

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh
Even now, it's more than I can take

I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are hoes, he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic to let it
Get me involved in that he said, she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it, and believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh

My man is smooth like Barry and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home, he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on cloud nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Mine'll rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mack ****
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like 7-Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

You know what I'm sayin'? He's a mighty, mighty good man, y'all
Y'all don't hear me, now check him out

My man gives real loving, that's why I call him killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker, 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that (I've got a good man)

Driven to distraction I was captured by the game
I have often wondered why I ever wanted to
Leave these scattered hours behind me and speed myself to you

I want our lips to kiss
And our limbs to entwine
Let our bodies be twisted
But never our minds

Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?

Shake these thoughts
Had I planned them
They never would be teasing me
As viciously as these

I would not have believed you had I never seen
Now you and I are intimately pictured in my dreams
I could not forsake you or for tumbling away
And if I live in wonderland I'm better off this way

And our limbs to entwine
Let our bodies be twisted

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds

Headed north on Mills Avenue
And listened to the engine roar

A girl named Cathy wants a little of my time
Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking
Ahaha! Listen to the engine whine

I am going to make it through this year if it kills me

I played video games in a drunken haze
I was seventeen years young
Hurt my knuckles punching the machines
The taste of Scotch rich on my tongue

And then Cathy showed up and we hung out
Trading swigs from a bottle all bitter and clean
Locking eyes, holding hands
Twin high-maintenance machines

I am going to make it through this year if it kills me
I am going to make it through this year if it kills me

I drove home in the California dusk
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face
Ready for the bad things to come
I downshifted as I pulled into the driveway
The motor screaming out, stuck in second gear
The scene ends badly, as you might imagine
In a cavalcade of anger and fear
There will be feasting and dancing in Jerusalem next year

""She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party

Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well, another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people, but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'd be happy
Just one more year and then you'd be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now


Way down the street, there's a light in his place
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin'
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone

Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again,Bob Dylan,51,136,47,75,30,63,10,-10,11B,"Oh, the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block
I'd ask him what the matter was
But I know that he don't talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And they furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart
I know I can't escape

Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if she's talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked

Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
And I said, ""Oh, I didn't know that
But then again, there's only one I've met
And he just smoked my eyelids
And punched my cigarette""

Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile

Grandpa died last week
And now he's buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked
But me, I expected it to happen
I knew he'd lost control
When I sp— he'd built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes

Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the senator came down here
Showing everyone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
And me, I nearly got busted
And wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck

Oh, Mama
Is this really the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the tea preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved to him
Then I whispered, said, ""Not even you can hide
You see, you're just like me
I hope you're satisfied""

Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said, ""Jump right in""
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
And like a fool I mixed them
And it strangled up my mind
And now people just get uglier
And I have no sense of time

Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile

Now when Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
'Neath her Panamanian moon
And I say, ""Aw, come on now
You know you know about my debutante""
And she says, ""Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want""

Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile

Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly

Simple Twist of Fate,Bob Dylan,59,137,41,26,67,36,10,-16,12B,"They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far-off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate


He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait?
One more time, for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate",256,folk,folk rock

Not About Love,Fiona Apple,50,138,42,42,17,11,10,-9,8B,"The early cars already are
Drawing deep breaths past my door
And last night's phrases, sick with lack of basis
Are still writhing on my floor
And it doesn't seem fair
That your wicked words should work in holding me down
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information given at close range
For the gag and the bind and the ammunition round
Conversation, once colored by esteem
Became dialogue as a diagram of a play for blood
Took a vacation; my palate got clean
Now I can taste your agenda while you're spitting your cud
And it doesn't make sense
I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown
It doesn't seem right
To take information given at close range
For the gag and the bind and the ammunition round

This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache
""What is this posture I have to stare at""
That's what he said when I was sitting up straight
Changed the name of the game 'cause he lost it
He knew he was wrong, but he knew it too late
But I'm not being fair 'cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth
But I'd like to choose right
Take all the things that I said that he stole
Put 'em in a sack, swing 'em over my shoulder
Turn on my heels, step out of his sight
Try to live in a lovelier light

This is not about love

See the oil fields at first light

When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor’s sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Coming from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away

Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh

Maggie's Song,Chris Stapleton,65,133,67,48,40,48,10,-9,9B,"Let me tell you a story
About an old friend of mine
Somebody left her in a shopping cart
In a parking lot for us to find
Just a fuzzy black pup
She was hungry and feeling alone
We put her in the back seat
And told her we were takin' her home

Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild

A few kids later
We moved out on the farm
And she followed those kids around
Yeah, she kept them safe from harm
And she loved to chase squirrels
And playin' out in the snow
She'd take off like a bullet
Man, you should have seen her go

Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild

It was rainin' on a Monday
The day that Maggie died
She woke up and couldn't use her legs
So I laid down by her side
She put her head on my hand
Like she'd done so many times
I told her she was a good dog
Then I told her goodbye

Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild

I had a revelation
As the tractor dug a hole
I can tell you right now
That a dog has a soul
And I thought to myself
As we buried her on the hill
I never knew me a better dog
And I guess I never will

Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild
Oh, run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild",211,country,country

I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly
From the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be
In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me

What a curious life
We have found here tonight
There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With the one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
And when we meet on a cloud

I'll be laughing with everyone I see

With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over

It's All Coming Back to Me Now,Céline Dion,76,88,38,44,75,29,10,-9,8B,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse, and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever (Forever)
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me

Would That I,Hozier,78,131,52,53,24,50,10,-6,7B,"True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
A willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicoes
Over canopy dapple long ago

True that love in withdrawal was the weepin' of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
I fretted fire, but that was long ago

And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh)

Light a fire bright (Oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)

With the roar of the fire, my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash I saw rise in the heat
Settle soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago

With each love I cut loose, I was never the same
Watching still-living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Layin' waste to my lovin' long ago

That's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (Oh, oh)

Oh, let it blaze alright, honey (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)

So in awe, there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
Long as amber of ember glows
All the ""would that I'd loved"" is long ago

And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)

You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise, there, you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)

Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive

Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy 'til you spend a lot of money

Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?

Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental

Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town but you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance

Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers

Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
Alright Richie!

Woo!
Ooh

What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince

But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more, that's not what I had in mind

The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh, oh, oh
A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering

Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas

MC's Act Like They Don't Know,KRS-One,57,90,86,80,1,86,60,-4,3B,"Clap your hands everybody, if you got what it takes
'Cause I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on the breaks
Goin' out to the hardcore Hip-Hop
Goin' out to the hardcore Hip-Hop
Of course we don't flip flop

If you don't know me by now, I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, ""Ill""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive, the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper – down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads, or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Wanna kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around, I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember ""You Must Learn""
About the styles I flip, and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler, or player
But make sure live, you is a dope rhyme sayer

MC's act like they don't know
MC's act like they don't know
MC's act like they don't know
MC's act like they don't know

This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw, I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow, let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments
My style is toxic, when I rock and shock and Hip-Hop it
Unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it

MC's act like they don't know
MC's act like they don't know
MC's act like they don't know
MC's act like they don't know

Some MC's don't like the KRS, but they must respect him
'Cause they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' 'em, checkin' 'em, disrespectin' 'em
Just deckin' 'em, deckin' 'em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine?
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tangle with the likes of these
Cross your T's and dot your I's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like Artifacts
On the ""Wrong Side of Da Tracks,"" electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defense mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad izm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em

By your sweet side, that’s the place where I belong
Couldn't find the answer, oh, I lived for ridicule

Oh, you could see through all of my charades

Time just a taste of heaven, every day was bliss
How can flesh and bone collide and make me feel like this
You could deny this world and I'd agree
Now you're out there keeping all your love from me

Maybe I'm just cursed to be the one you couldn't save
If you'd only just return then I would be your slave
Oh, I swear I'll spend every day in chains
Every kiss that you ever gave me still remains

I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said, ""I never seen a man, who looks so all alone
Oh, could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice
And you can go and send me on my way.""
I said, ""You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said:

""Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""

Not even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
He said, ""Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life
But if you try to make a move, I won't think twice""
I told him, ""You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?""

The day was winding down and coming to an end
And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news

I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same

Roll the dice on my thighs

Well, the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
I had a beer and now I hear you callin' out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the room is crowded—people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well, if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we can make it
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the night does funny things inside a man
These old tomcat feelings you don't understand
Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

I can see that you are lonesome just like me
And it being late, you'd like some company
Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
The guy you're with, he's up and split—the chair next to you is free
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me

Now, it's closing time
The music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
Well, I turn around to look at you—you're nowhere to be found
I search the place for your lost face—guess I'll have another round
