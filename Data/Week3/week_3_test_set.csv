Born To Die,Lana Del Rey,53,76,18,64,21,39,20,-7,9A,"Why? (Got that?)
Who? Me? (Louder)
Why? (Got that?)

Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (Louder)

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (Louder, alright)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost, but now I am found
I can see that, once, I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey (Louder)

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (Louder, alright)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

(We were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die
(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

So don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain

I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I'd have to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
Your love was the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

Oh, when my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more

You make me feel

Oh, baby, what you've done to me (what you've done to me)

I said some things I shouldn't have
I wanna make it up to you
How can I prove I'm on track?
(you're / your) storming out of my room's
The only way I can picture you
And it's been 48 hours, you've made your point now
So come back
Sorry I know that comment wasn't funny
Just wanted you to love me
But I didn't go about it right
Sometimes the best advice that I can give
Is to bite my lip and listen
With my big fat mouth shut tight
And now I think I still can smell you on me
Even after doing laundry
But it might be in my head
And would you still stay mad at me forever
If we just had each other
It was all that we had left?
Try to fit my feet in your shoes
I see that I can't have your love and eat/need it too
But it's been 48 hours, enough of this now
I need you

Sorry I know I tend to go too far
Making everything an argument
I didn't mean to make you cry
Sometimes the best advice that I can give
Is to bite my lip and listen
With my big fat mouth shut tight
And now I think I still can smell you on me
Even after doing laundry
But it might be in my head
And would you still stay mad at me forever
If we just had each other
It was all that we had left?
Oh what if Jesus left without us
And we just didn't notice
When he took up all our friends?
What if the Lord came back and left without us
And we just didn't notice

And check out my man, he goes by the name of, er, uh

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it

Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, **** the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again

And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well, never mind
We are ugly but we have the music""

And then you got away didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jivin' around

Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds?
So I can find someone to rely on

And run to them, to them

I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say, ""You gotta stay hungry""
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, give me just one look

You can't start a fire

The crime was looking up the truth
And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode
I try to trace them to my youth

And then you had to bring up reincarnation
Over a couple of beers the other night
And now I'm serving time for mistakes
Made by another in another lifetime

How long 'til my soul gets it right?
Can any human being ever reach that kind of light?
I call on the resting soul of Galileo
King of night vision, king of insight

And then I think about my fear of motion
Which I never could explain
Some other fool across the ocean years ago
Must have crashed his little airplane

How long 'til my soul gets it right?
Can any human being ever reach that kind of light?
I call on the resting soul of Galileo
King of night vision, king of insight

I'm not making a joke, you know me
I take everything so seriously
If we wait for the time 'til all souls get it right
Then at least I know there'll be no nuclear annihilation
In my lifetime, I'm still not right

I offer thanks to those before me
That's all I've got to say
'Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime
Now I have to pay

But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration
To let the next life off the hook
But she'll say, ""Look what I had to overcome from my last life
I think I'll write a book""

How long 'til my soul gets it right?
Can any human being ever reach the highest light?
Except for Galileo—God rest his soul

You wear fancy Adidas”

Gangsta's Paradise,"Coolio,L.V.",88,80,65,51,7,39,40,-10,4B,"Hi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Coolio. Now, I don't think pop music history as a whole has been very kind to Coolio, since as far as I can remember, everyone's kind of taken him to be a bit of a joke, a rapper to not be taken seriously. When you talk about the biggest names in hiphop in the 90's, the names that are often tossed around are cats like Biggie Smalls, Wu-Tang, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Nas, but I almost never hear any praise for Coolio, which is interesting, because, I mean, he wasn't a bad rapper or anything, he was decent enough, and the man had multiple hits back in the day, and in fact, the song I'm reviewing today, became the first rap song to be number 1 on the billboards year-end charts, so people knew who he was, and, I think people still know who he is, he's not some obscure reference that time forgot, I just think that, well, people don't really respect Coolio as far as Hiphop is concerned, and, hey, I get it, the guy's name is a portmanteau of ""cool"" and ""yo"", his name couldn't sound like a more cheesy ""urban"" buzzword if he called himself ""nahmean-nahmsayin"", and yeah, at the height of his fame, he did rap the theme song for a kids' t.v. show, definitely not the most gangsta thing to do in hindsight, but I'll defend that move, because, hey, Kenan and Kel was a good show, and he never struck me as someone who was trying to be a super thug or anything, But hey, honestly: it was the hair, wasn't it? Yeah, it was probably the hair. I mean, few things are gonna make you look like a comical portrayal of hip hop's aggressiveness than gravity defying braids. *I refuse to bow down to any law written by a white man, and neither will my hair!* But yeah, while I think the zero G braids were cool, it's not exactly the most toned down look you could have. I mean, if the only other rapper rocking' a similar hairstyle to you is this guy:
*show ODB with hair*
You might wanna go for something different if you want to be taken seriously. It's also not helping that, despite the fact that he's currently balding, he's decided to keep his braids up, on the two little islands of hair left on his head. Dude, cut that off, man! Go out with some dignity! *looks over* Oh, what's that? He's doing soundtracks for porn websites now? …alright… And I will say that, in addition, it's not like ""Gangsta's Paradise was the only type of music he was making. His first hit was actually this:
""Fantastic Voyage""
Yeah, a lot of his stuff was actually a lot more party oriented, but with a hardcore rap slant to it. And actually, if you think about it, his first smash hit was a song that actually serves as a transitional point for what was happening in hiphop at the time. ""Fantastic Voyage"" was released in 1994, the time period in Hiphop where rap in the mainstream charts was losing it's grip on happy dance music like C+C Music factory and Kid n Play in favor of hardcore rap like 2Pac and Bone Thugz N Harmony dominating the charts. And ""Fantastic Voyage"" represented the harder edge of that party music, but a lighter side of gangsta funk, with the bouncing bass and synth sounds commonly associated with Dr. Dre's style of harsher, thugged out rap personas, while the song, indeed incorporating themes of ghetto culture, had a main message about Coolio wishing he could close his eyes and escape the dangers of his neighborhood
Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside
Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
A Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by
And ya know, where this song encapsulated the transition of trends in mainstream rap, this happier joint wasn't the one people remembered the most. The one that topped the charts and solidified Coolio into the minds of millions was the song, ""Gangsta's Paradise"". This, in my eyes, is the quintessential song that represented Hiphop's identity as a genre and at the same time, echoed the mind set of Black culture in American Society in the 90's. In fact, I'd dare say that few songs that got this popular in the 90's really summed up the overall feel of the decade, at least as far as hiphop and it's young audience was concerned
*video starts*
You know, I actually think that, in addition to this song being good, this is quite an audacious music video here, A because it's one of the very few music videos for a song on a movie's soundtrack that actually tried to incorporate what was happening in the movie clips with what was happening in the actual video (seriously, how many music videos have you watched where they just randomly throw clips or t.v. screens in there showing parts of a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the context of the video?), and B, because it ties so well into the movie that this is from, ""Dangerous Minds"", a movie about an upper class teacher coming into a poor neighborhood to get the hardest kids to teach interested in learning. Now, I can't tell you how good the movie is at portraying this, as I haven't seen it in a while, but I don't remember it being too terrible; however, the way they tie it into the music video itself, actually having Michelle Pfeiffer in the video for a cameo, was pretty cool. And then, she says the line:
""You wanna tell me what this is all about""

Which sets off the tone in a fitting way, as here is this person of upper class privilege coming into the darker world of poverty… *ahem* visually, but uh… I guess you could say ""ethnically"" as well, and she wants to know what this is all about, what is happening in the minds of the people of this environment. And this song and video served as a microcosmic interpretation of what was happening in the black community as gangsta rap got more popular in the homes of the people typically located outsides the confines of hip hop's culture at the time… ya know… upper class white folk
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
Right of the bat, we start with Coolio interpolating a quote from Psalms, chapter 23, verse 4, and where, in the original context, the verse describes being comforted by a loving God through hardships, inciting hope and faith, Coolio contrasts that with being unassured of his life's path, saying that, now that he's gone down this road, there's no way out for him, nothing left for him to do but ride out this path of destruction until his demise, and that, in addition, no one believes in his ability to be anything more than a lowlife thug
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
*eyes get low* I'm gonna assume that this rhyme scheme is actually a clever way to indicate that Coolio's character had a neglectful elementary school teacher, and instead focus on the content, where he defends his motives, citing that, despite everyone on the outside wanting to portray his actions as thoughtless and unjustified, that they arise from an instinct that comes from living in an environment where survival means killing any man who poses a threat
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Now this is interesting imagery. He might be saying that he actually sees himself in the smoke, which… probably isn't likely, since smoke isn't very reflective, OR, he could be saying that he sees the smoke, the result of the fired pistol, as a part of him, he sees himself IN it, and what pistol smoke is, is an aftereffect of a violent action, which is what he embodies as what he is: an aftereffect of a violent society
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Going back to my point that this song encapsulates the 90's, we have a heavily sampled beat and chorus, which flips a Stevie Wonder song, but gives it a darker, more sinister tint

*play original*
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
You know, I really like it when a song not only uses a sample, but changes the feel of it, as Stevie Wonder's original version sounds more cerebral and contemplative, as from what I can tell from it's cryptic writing, is about people who are obsessed with the past and waste their lives reminiscing on a time that might not actually be as great as they thought it might have been, not focusing on the problems that are present in front of them, people who may be lost or insecure, and are seeking something to comfort them, similar to the psalm quoted at the beginning of Coolio's verse. Now, what do they do to flip it?
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
So here, L.V., the singer, is saying that they've been surrounded by the exact type of environment that criminals thrive off of, just as dead animals attract buzzards, the environment that they have been born into, the hood, attracts criminal activity. So, when you're born into it, why WOULDN'T you get caught up in it? It doesn't matter what type of person you throw into it, either: this environment we live in invites criminals based on the way it functions. So, as you may have guessed, the word ""paradise"" is a subversion of what the word typically represents. And whereas a lesser emcee would have used the ""paradise"" angle to blast on the fleeting perks that come with that life, like maybe the rush of drugs, easy women and power, this song focuses mainly on how this paradise is in reality festering pool of negative energy that inherently drags you down
Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
And I pretty much… just explained that line before it happened…
So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
And in this lyric, he throws a quick jab at television's typical portrayal of life, as frequently on t.v., we see the lives of those who live 10 times better than we may ever live, and it causes us to not be content with reality, to chase after a shallow, predetermined expectation of success
Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'

A lot can be said about this guy's cadence, which has gruff but ear-catching vocal inflection, so that each line rises in it's energy and pitch, that when it gets to the end of the 4th line in the couplet, you've heard this build up of tension, leading to him saying that everyone's afraid of him, scared of who he is and what he represents, and when he says that last line, it honestly comes across as a man who doesn't know what's wrong with himself, why he is the way he is, what even motivates his actions anymore. And what really cranks this song up to what it represents is broken down in the last few lines:
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!
This is honestly to me, one of the most important lyrics in Hiphop here. In lower class communities, our school systems keep getting their budgets gutted every year, and we have to deal with bad teachers, outdated books, and a biased educational system that doesn't care if students actually learned anything as long as they mindlessly memorize facts for tests that will never apply to their every day lives. Here, he makes it plain, in a general sense: if our own government doesn't see the value in our intelligence, and actively doesn't care about our well-being, if the ones in charge don't want to help us, and actively cut the funding for education, and has authority figures that abuse their power for their own gain at my expense, why do I need to care about what their institution wants to tell me? THAT, my friends, is what the youth of the 90's were going through in poor neighborhoods, and for the first real time in music history, you had to pay attention to the unedited words of a disenfranchised chunk of America, the people that were once glossed over are now in your face, and you had to be uncomfortable, you had to see what America's racist, classist system had done to those not lucky enough to be born in a suburban neighborhood, and FINALLY, AMERICA, YOU HAD TO LOOK YOUR PROBLEMS IN THE EYE, AND ONCE YOU DID THAT, YOU HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO… *sigh* assimilate the culture into a watered down caricature of it's former self, without really understanding it's problems, draining it of any impact, and grossly rewarded those who exploited and exaggerated the ills of it's lifestyle. Life is stupid like that…
Anyways, I give this song a 5 out of 5 stars. You know, a lot of mainstream rap songs talked about being gangsta and hardcore, but very few gave you a look into the paranoid persona, the pessimistic, self-destructive thought processes that come with it, at least very few have done it in ways that didn't come off as just trying to sound cool. I didn't feel like he enjoyed any of this. I felt like he hated this lifestyle, he hated himself, and he hated the world that put him here. This song is a lament, it is a dark evaluation of what was going on in the heart of Hiphop, and it was needed in pop culture, and… hey, this song was also parodied by Weird Al… I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose...",240,hip hop,hip hop 90s

The pleasures of a journey to the center of the mind

Come along if you dare
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind

Beyond the seas of thought
Beyond the realm of what
Across the streams of hopes and dreams where things are really not

Come along if you care
Come along if you dare
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind

You'll probably be surprised
For it's the land unknown to man
Where fantasy is fact
So if you can, please understand

Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can’t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere

In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere

In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright

And they've conjured spirits to make you smile

Missed the Boat,Modest Mouse,60,104,71,70,7,85,40,-6,10B,"While we're on the subject
Could we change the subject now?
I was knocking on your ear's door
But you were always out
Looking towards the future
We were begging for the past
Well, we knew we had the good things
But those never seemed to last
Oh, please just last

Everyone's unhappy
Everyone's ashamed
Well, we all just got caught looking
At somebody else's page
Well, nothing ever went
Quite exactly as we planned
Our ideas held no water
But we used them like a dam

Oh, and we carried it all so well
As if we got a new position
Oh, and I'll laugh all the way to Hell
Sayin', ""Yes, this is a fine promotion""
Oh, and I'll laugh all the way to Hell

Of course, everyone goes crazy
Over such and such and such
We made ourselves a pillar
We just used it as a crutch
We were certainly uncertain
At least, I'm pretty sure I am
Well, we didn't need the water
But we just built that good Goddamn!

Oh, and I know this of myself
I assume as much for other people
Oh, and I know this of myself
We've listened more to life's end gong than
The sound of life's sweet bells

Was it ever worth it?
Was there all that much to gain?
Well, we knew we'd missed the boat
And we'd already missed the plane
We didn't read the invite
We just danced at our own wake
All our favorites were a-playing
So we could shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Tiny curtains open and we heard the
Tiny clap of little hands, a tiny
Man would tell a little joke, and get a
Tiny laugh from all the folks, sittin'
Driftin' around on bubbles then
Thinkin' it was us that carried them
When we finally got it figured out
That we had truly missed the boat

Oh, and we carried it all so well

Oh, and we owned all the tools ourselves

Miracles would have to save

Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

And thought his timeless soul had gone, gone
In empty burning hell, unholy one
But he's returned to prove them wrong, so wrong

Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

And sank Manhattan out at sea

Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow

And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""

Waited for somethin' to come along

Unfucktheworld,Angel Olsen,49,119,55,13,94,33,10,-13,8B,"This is the opening song of Olsen’s second album and describes contemplations of how to deal with changes in life and facing that you’re ultimately on your own in managing them.
I quit my dreaming the moment that I found you
I started dancing just to be around you
Here's to thinking that it all meant so much more
I kept my mouth shut and opened up the door

I wanted nothing but for this to be the end
For this to never be a tired and empty hand
If all the trouble in my heart would only mend
I lost my dream, I lost my reason all again

It's not just me for you
I have to look out too
I have to save my life
I need some peace of mind
I am the only one now
I am the only one now
I am the only one now
You may not be around
You may not be around
You may not be around

Until that first hello, until that first smile
But if I had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing
Cause this love is everlasting

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love
Ooh yeah

Girl you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough
To say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before
Now you're all I'm living for

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

I pray, this love affair would last forever

To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
No one knows what it's like
To be hated, to be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger, none of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool
And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over God's world
You don't remember when you got your last meal
And you forgot just how a woman feels
You didn't know what Rock 'n' Roll was
Until you met a drummer on a Greyhound bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line

Well in the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh-so cold
You're gettin' tired, you're lookin' kinda beat
The music of the street, drive you off your feet
You didn't know how rock 'n' roll looked
Until you caught your sister with a guy from the group
Half-way home in the parking lot
By the look in her eyes she was givin' what she got

Once bitten twice shy, babe
Once bitten twice shy, babe
Once bitten twice shy, babe

Woman you're a mess gonna die in your sleep
All the blood on my hand and my Les Paul heat
I can't leave you home 'cos you're runnin' around
My best friend told me you're the best trick in town
You didn't know that Rock 'n' Roll burned
So you bought a candle and you loved and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mamma's little baby likes it short and sweet

Once bitten twice shy, babe
Once bitten twice shy, babe
Once bitten twice shy, babe

I didn't know ya got a Rock 'n' Roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one

Its colors' richness won't appear within your view
I'll never glow the way that you glow
Your presence dominates the judgements made on you

But as the scenery grows, I see in different lights
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch, I see from greater heights
I understand what I am still too proud to mention to you

You'll say you understand, but you don't understand
You'll say you'd never give up seeing eye to eye
But ""never"" is a promise and you can't afford to lie

You'll never touch these things that I hold
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own
You'll never feel the heat of this soul
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown to you

You'll say ""Don't fear your dreams, it's easier than it seems""
You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so high
But ""never"" is a promise and you can't afford to lie

You'll never live this life that I live
I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night
You'll never hear the message I give
You'll say it looks as though I might give up this fight

Year of the Cat,Al Stewart,61,116,54,63,2,55,10,-9,9A,"{Instrumental Lead In}

On a morning from a Bogart movie in a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre, contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations, she'll just tell you that she came

In the Year of the Cat

She doesn't give you time for questions as she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow till your sense of which direction completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls, there's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says: ""I feel my life!"" Just like a river running through

The Year of the Cat

Well, she looks at you so coolly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in Incense and Patchouli
So, you take her to find what's waiting inside

The Year of the Cat
{Instrumental Bridge}

Well, morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket
So, you have to stay on
But, the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But, for now you're going to stay

But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain
To hear the jazz go down

You check out guitar George

Mind, it's strictly rhythm

When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind

He's got a daytime job
He's doing alright
He can play the honky-tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night

Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band

Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole

You're living for nothing now,  I hope you're keeping some kind of record

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?

Oh, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train
Then you came home without Lili Marlene
And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back, she was nobody's wife

Well, I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well, I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer?
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you. I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way
If you ever come by here for Jane or for me
Well, your enemy is sleeping and his woman is free

Yes, and thanks for the trouble you took from her eyes

Parking by the lake and there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school, they were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
Well, c'mon! Hold on tight!

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night

'Cause we were barely seventeen and we were barely dressed
Ain't no doubt about it, baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it, we were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen and we were barely dressed

Baby, don'tcha hear my heart? You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long for you to come along and have some fun
And I gotta let you know, no, you never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes, I got a big surprise, it'll feel all right

OK, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here
Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth
There's the windup, and there it is, a line shot up the middle
Look at him go. This boy can really fly!
He's rounding first and really turning it on now
He's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for Second
The ball is bobbled out in center, and here comes the throw
And what a throw! He's gonna slide in head first
Here he comes, he's out! No, wait, safe - safe at second base
This kid really makes things happen out there
Batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch-he's going
And what a jump he's got. He's trying for third, here's the throw
It's in the dirt-safe at third! Holy cow, stolen base!
He's taking a pretty big lead out there
Almost daring him to try and pick him off
The pitcher glances over, winds up, and it's bunted
Bunted down the third base line, the suicide squeeze is on!
Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close, here's the throw, here's the play at the plate
Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it!

I couldn't take it any longer, Lord I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me like a tidal wave
Started swearing to my God and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore that I would love you to the end of time!
So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time, it's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time so I can end my time with you!

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there

Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
Make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there

Her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me

Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage

Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break

With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now, I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slides up around the belly face down on the mattress
One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still, it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself, heavy on the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want something else

You say that you're at home, alone right now

Climb so high, tell me how to feel

Three weighed ounce pure golden ring, no precious stone
Five nights without a bite, no place to lay his head
And if nobody takes him in he'll soon be dead

On the street he spied my face, I heard him hail
In our plot of frozen space he told his tale
Poor man, he showed his hand, so righteous was his need
And, me, so wise I bought his prize for chicken feed

Newfound cash soon begs to smash a state of mind
Close inspection fast revealed his favorite kind
Poor kid, he overdid, embraced the spreading haze
And while he sighed his body died in fifteen ways

When I heard I grabbed a cab to where he lay

You said, ""Hey, wish that was me up there
It's the biggest rocket I could find
And it's holding the night in its arms
If only for a moment
I can't see the look in its eyes
But I'm sure it must be laughing""

But it seemed to me
The saddest thing I'd ever seen
And I, I thought you were crazy
Wishing such a thing
I saw only a stick on fire
Alone on its journey
Home to the quickening ground
With no one there to catch it

I put on my pointed hat
And my black and silver suit
And I, I check my gunpowder pack
And I strap the stick on my back
And dressed as a rocket on Watеrloo Bridge
Nobody seems to see me
Then with thе fuse in my hand
And now shooting into the night


And still as a rocket, I land in the river
Was it me said you were crazy?

And in the morning kick me in the head

Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band

And Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life”

And a couple of paintings from Sears

They started to fight when the money got tight
And they just didn't count on the tears
Ohh, ohh...

Yeah, rock and roll!

Ohh, ohh, ohh...

Well, they lived for a while in a very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce, as a matter, of course
And they parted, the closest of friends
Then the king and the queen went back to the green
But you can never go back there again

Hoping that you call me

And knowing you’re not
So call me a princess
Get that a lot
At least I own up
To the things that I’m not
And you just destroy, destroy, all my confidence
I’m just a boy with a voice and an audience

You never learned how to suck on my cockiness

Co-writer Elton John performs the piano on this song.
Wake up in the morning with a head like, ""What ya done?""
This used to be the life, but I don't need another one
You like cuttin' up and carryin' on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up gettin' down?

So I'll play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You'd better move when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like the magic's only ours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today
I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colours it'd make a blind man so confused
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I'd lose?

So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around, I'm sure that I'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound
Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer lights

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way

In ten minutes, she started yellin' (Come and get it!)
And the gettin's were good

Sit back, relax, listen to some hip-hop

Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes
A sight for sore ones and some bore pies
And other goodies that are filled with goop
With fried apple roots
Delectable delights, control my appetites
Mines is for me, right, but I know what I like
Chicken for lunch, chicken for my dinner
Chicken, chicken, chicken, I'm a finger lickin' winner
When breakfast time comes, I don't recognize

Mixed with stewed tomatoes, home fried potatoes

Hurricane,Bob Dylan,73,136,51,83,4,74,10,-8,8B,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”

Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there, does Patty see
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously
“I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands
“I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand

I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“One of us had better call up the cops”
And so Patty calls the cops, and they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin' in the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that’s just the way things go
If you’re black, you might as well not show up on the street
Unless you want to draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
He said, “I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him he could identify the guilty men

Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
They take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Say, “Why did you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!”

Here’s the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin’s in South America, fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame

“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw
Running that night?”
“Don’t forget that you are white”

Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
The cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job, and we’re talking to your friend Bello
Now you don’t want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow

You’ll be doing society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder
On him
He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
""It’s my work"", he’d say, ""and I do it for pay""
""And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way""

Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum

And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder “one”, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land where justice is a game

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink Martinis, and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell

Yes that’s the story of the Hurricane
But it won’t be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he’s done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world",512,folk,folk rock

Was picked up by Smokey (=Smokie) in 1976 with much greater success.
Sally called, when she got the word
She said ""I suppose you've heard
About Alice""
Well I rushed to the window, and I looked outside
But I could hardly believe my eyes
As a big limousine rolled up into Alice's drive

Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't want to know
'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice

Twenty-four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice

We grew up together, two kids in the park
Carved our initials deep in the bark
Me and Alice
Now she walks through the door with her head held high
Just for a moment I caught her eye
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive

Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know

And she said ""I know how to help
Get over Alice""
She said ""Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here
You know I've been waitin' for twenty-four years""
And the big limousine disappeared

I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go

And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me

Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hmm
But there I was, mmm

Short ones, brown ones

Came a lady
She whispered in my ear

She said

""Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl""

What could that mean?
Am I going crazy
Or is this just a dream?
Now wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head

I heard her say one more time

""Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl""

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it
She said

""Take the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Come on, come on
Spill the wine, take that pearl""

Take that pearl, yeah
It's all yours
All you've gotta do is
Spill that wine, spill that wine
Make me feel
Make me feel fine, yeah, yeah

My head, is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an okay guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
But it came back with a story to say


Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From Dirty Paws and the creatures of snow

So for a while, things were cold
They were scared down in their holes

Was colored black by those killing machines
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws

Are rolling by like thunder now as I look into your eyes
I hold on to your body and feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender, a love that I could not forsake

Cause I am your lady and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
Lost is how I'm feeling, lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
But never wonder where I am
Cause I am always by your side

Cause I am your lady, and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love

The feeling that I can't go on is light-years away

The way I talk, I guess I got it from my pops
Product of some kneelin' down
In a town where the doors don't lock
And there's a million other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks, a backroad gets old
But for me, it just can't

'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country

Somewhere now, someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day, a baby's born with some baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five
I'm just another southern hell raiser
Ain't breakin' ground
Makin' sound for them drop-it-down tailgaters
But y'all, that's all I know to say
So if you think I'm full of it, ain't done it, check the resume

When I kicked you to the curb?
Now I’m all alone
I guess I’ll never learn

Your purple sweater's sitting in my room
I tried to wear it, but I knew that it would smell like you
I saw you dancing at the show tonight
I stood in the back
And I think that we both know why

Did it hurt
When I kicked you to the curb?
Now I’m all alone
I guess I’ll never learn

And I lied
When I took you on a drive
And I said I’d never speak to her

You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror, as you watched yourself gavotte

And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner and

You're so vain

You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you

You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me

I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee and

You're so vain

And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not

You're with some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend and

I hate calling the women ""bitches,"" but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?

The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd

I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that

Be – b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun, 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV, like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful – some men be
Rapists – so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so?
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know?
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men, and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)

Be – be–fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from Black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money, it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander The Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with Black faces
Shot up they nose, to impose, what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive, until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king!
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen!""

I know I can (I know I can)

And now I'm riding all over this island
Looking for something to open my eyes

I know you've got somewhere to go
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

Sun ain't nearly on the rise
We still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies, love is all that matters
Won't you stay with me?
Don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
Don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, there's no need to leave so soon

I must admit on some occasions
I went out like a punk and a chump
Or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect — I used to never get 'cause all I got was upset
When niggas used to be like (""What's up, fool?! Nigga, what's up?!"")
And tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip
For no reason at all, I can recall niggas throwing Cs in my face
Down the hall, I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at three
Wondering, ""Why is everybody always pickin' on me?""
I tried to talk and tell them, chill, I did nothin' to deserve this
But when it didn't work, I wasn't scared, just real nervous and unprepared
To deal with scrappin' no doubt
My pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out
But now in '95, I must survive as a man on my own

When he's gotta handle shit up on his own

Please, they got problems of they own
Down for the count on seven chickenshits don't get to heaven
'Til they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked, back up in high school, I played it cool
Just so some real shit won't get full blown bein' where I'm from
They let the smoke come quicker than an evil redneck
Could lynch a helpless, colored figure
And, as a victim, I invented low-key
'Til the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my freeform form free
Said I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me
I don't sweat it, I let the bullshit blow in the breeze

Let's make this fleeting moment last forever
So, tell me what you waiting for
I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever

It's worth the wait, even so far away
I'm making the night mine until the day I die
No light to brake when you're hanging by fate

In the zone where the beat is uncontrolled

Open up your eyes
And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter
Come on, make me feel until the pain don't matter
Every second here makes my heart beat faster
Finally think I found what I'm chasing after

All alone, just the beat inside my soul
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold

I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tris
I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right
Easy, baby, my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
I ain't thinking, I ain't right, can't decide, but I can't fight
Easy, baby, you the bomb and all but I be damned if I do not land mine
Or at least try, can I speak up? Was it peace out? Can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots? What's your flavor? Flat drinks we call A cups
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it's done right

No need in mixing misery and gin

Will warm your heart
